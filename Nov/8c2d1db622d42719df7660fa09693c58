The ANC NEC will decide this morning whether the Oscar Mabuyane-led provincial executive committee is legitimate or not. This follows a heated national executive committee meeting on Saturday which sent the party’s national working committee members packing after the NEC  realised a report the structure presented on events leading to Mabuyane’s PEC election into office last month lacked detail. The NWC met behind closed doors for the most part of Sunday, refining the report. DispatchLIVE can reveal that the NEC remains deeply divided on whether to disband the PEC of the party’s historical heartland. The Sunday night meeting of the NEC, the ANC’s highest decision making body between conferences, was shelved for 10am today. The item of whether the Eastern Cape ANC PEC is legitimate or not has been discussed in the special NEC since Saturday.
