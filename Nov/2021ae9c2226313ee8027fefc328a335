By: Mzilikazi Wa Afrika‚ Njabulo Ncube‚ Tawanda Karombo And Ray Ndlovu As tens of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets on Saturday‚ embattled President Robert Mugabe was expected to be recalled by the Zanu-PF central committee on Sunday or Monday‚ the Sunday Times reported. If he refuses to exit gracefully‚ he will face an impeachment motion in parliament next week‚ the newspaper said.
By Saturday‚ eight out of the 10 Zanu-PF provinces had passed a vote of no confidence in Mugabe and his wife‚ Grace. The ruling party has a two-thirds majority and will be supported by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change when parliament resumes sitting on Tuesday after a two-week break‚ the report said. The Sunday Times said it had learnt that the removal of Mugabe was plotted months ago‚ and kept a close secret by a small band of conspirators. – Sunday Times Source: TMG Digital.
