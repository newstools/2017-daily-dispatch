With President Robert Mugabe confined to his home, First Lady Grace Mugabe having allegedly fled to Namibia and three senior government officials arrested by the Zimbabwean army that has taken control of governance and a transitional government likely to run the country. Reporter Zikhona Moyikwa spoke to some Zimbabwean nationals in East London about the developments in their home country. This is what they had to say: Jaydee Nyamahono said: “This is the beginning of a new era for Zimbabwe because Mugabe has been the president way before I was born. I now have a child, he is still president. The country is better off without him. I cannot hide that I am happy, it is time for the old man to step down. The first lady should be removed as well, not to mention the [alleged] corrupt finance minister.” Misheck Mugabe said: “The president must make a smooth transition that will allow political and economic stability and social cohesion in the country. What I like about the army is … [that there has been] no bloodshed since they took over. “They are doing this peacefully. The army has shown they are not intending to kill the president … that is one of the things we applaud them for. “We are appreciative of what the president has done for some of us. I am now here in South Africa pursuing my tertiary education because of him and we have land all thanks to him.” Shaun Nakuve said: “This is a good move given the fact that people have been living in hardship. I hope his successor will build and leave a better legacy than him.” Max Savanhu said: “I want to see a better version of Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe we once knew. I am hoping for a stable economy. I don’t want our country to use US dollars anymore. This western economy is the one that brought us problems in the first place. “The government should focus on agriculture and improving the level of education so that Zimbabweans don’t go to other countries to study, as well as providing jobs for its people.”
