The Director of Public Prosecutions in Grahamstown has declined to prosecute the two men accused of starting a fire that burnt down parts of the Office of the Premier building on the afternoon of June 30.  The DPP has cited lack of evidence for declining to prosecute. The two Mpandlane Vellem, 54, and Simphiwe Sunduzayo, 39, appeared in the Zwelitsha Magistrateâ€™s Court this morning where the decision was made. The fire which engulfed the archives section of the building and caused widespread panic, reportedly compromised a seven-year probe into supply chain irregularities in various government departments. The affected facility stored thousands of supply chain management documents which were in the process of being digitally scanned for archiving.
