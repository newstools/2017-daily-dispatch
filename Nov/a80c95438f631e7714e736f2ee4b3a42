Police are investigating a house fire that caused the death of a reverend in Mdantsane in the early hours of this morning.
 Police spokesman Captain Nkosikho Mzuku said the reverend who is believed to be in his sixties was sleeping in the fourâ€“bedroom double-storey house with his two daughters aged 15 and seven, when the fire broke out. He said the fire was first spotted by neighbours at 3am who then rushed to the scene to assist the trapped family members. Mzuku said the neighbours about four of them managed to break the burglar windows and retrieved the two children but unfortunately could not get to the reverend in time. The reverend was burnt beyond recognition, Mzuku said. Firefighters were called to the scene to respond to the blaze. They managed to douse the fire by 5am. Mzuku said the cause of the fire was unknown and that an inquest docket had been opened for investigation. Forensic experts are currently on the scene assessing the damage.
