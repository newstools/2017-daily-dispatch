Pupils travelling to Gonubie High School yesterday morning had a lucky escape, sustaining only minor injuries, when the taxi they were travelling in lost control and overturned. The taxi, carrying 16 pupils, 14 of them in Grade 8 and two in Grade 9, was believed to have travelled from Mdantsane. It is alleged that the taxi driver was overtaking a truck on Gonubie Main road when he lost control of the vehicle. The taxi rolled across the road to the opposite lane before landing on its side. Nine pupils sustained minor injuries. Six were hospitalised at Life Beacon Bay and Frere hospitals. The rest were collected by the school bus and dropped at school for class. Department of education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said the department was waiting for reports from the hospitals detailing the extent of the injuries. “Most of the pupils got away with scratches and bruises. “We can confirm that five of the six pupils have already been discharged.” He said: “Pupils who will be missing exams due to injuries will definitely be allowed to [sit] special exams.”
