Ducats residents were dissatisfied with Mayor Xola Pakati’s visit to their township earlier today.  The mayor left the crowd almost without hope of when their service delivery issues will be dealt with. Instead he said he will have to go back to the drawing board. “We will hold discussions on the way forward with all the relevant parties,” he said. The residents main grievances were lack of electricity, better houses, proper sanitation. The complaints also laid with the issue of no schools and clinics in the area.
