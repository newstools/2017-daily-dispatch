Residents from parts of Mdantsane and surrounding areas braved the chilly East London weather to march on BCM over housing and billing issues.
 The residents are complaining about the ongoing housing issue and the tarriff billing system in the area. Kwanele People’s Movement leader Phumelele Phoswa said enough is enough. “There are people who are living in shared RDP houses since the previous regime. They were promised better houses and to be relocated to Unit P a long time ago,” said Phoswa. To add to the frustrations of the residents the current tarriffs billing system has caused much unrest in the community. “People are billed based on estimated charges, forcing them to pay exorbitant amounts which then results to the termination of services when they are unable to pay,” Phoswa said. The marchers handed their memorandum of grievances to infrastructure and engineering boss Ncedo Kumbaca. They have given the municipality seven days to respond to their grievances.
