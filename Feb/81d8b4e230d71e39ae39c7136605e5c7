Politicians have started trickling in for the #2017 SONA and apart from the big speech by President Jacob Zuma the red carpet and who is hot versus a hot mess has become the second big talking point about the prestigious event. Fashion designers Gert-Johan Coetzee of GJC Ole Ledimo of House of Ole and Gugu Mlambo Msomi of Gugulam are weighing in on the various looks:An early thumbs down went to Democratic Alliance MP Natasha Mazzoni. She arrived with her blonde locks curled and parted at the side in a red angel high-neck dress and matching red lipstick. The colour red makes her look bigger. The dress looks like it was not made for her. Not a well-made dress in my opinion said Ledimo.Oops: Coetzee said that the piece is one from his Spree online retail range although he did not dress her for the event.#SONA2017 DA MP Natasha Mazzoni arrives ahead of the speech. pic.twitter.com/zpgU1mKZiD&mdash; Bianca Capazorio (@wordnerd212) February 9, 2017DA MP Juanita Terblanche arrived in a vintage-inspired black velvet dress with pearls streaming down the mid-section of her back chandelier style.This won another reprimand from Ledimo who said: I m definitely not in favour of the Oscar look for the opening of Parliament. The pearls are definitely too heavy for that dress I think we get dress codes so wrong .Again Coetzee disagreed. I think it s beautiful a powerful look and nice on a red carpet said Coetzee.#SONA2017 DA MP Juanita Terblanche arrives in velvet and pearls. pic.twitter.com/RU2G6xWb9V&mdash; Bianca Capazorio (@wordnerd212) February 9, 2017
