A Thembu prince has filed an urgent application in the Grahamstown High Court to stop the Eastern Cape premier from recognising another prince as acting king. Prince Jongisizwe Mthandeni Mankunku wants the court to overturn Phumulo Masualle s decision to recognise and appoint Prince Azenathi Dalindyebo as acting king.The application comes a week after Masualle appointed Azenathi in terms of the Provincial Traditional Leadership and Governance Act.Masualle, who approved the appointment of Azenathi on February 8, is accused of making a decision that flies in the face of the findings of the Tolo Commission and those of the Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Minister Des Van Rooyen that Mankunku is the rightful acting king.In court papers, Mankunku says: The recognition of Azenathi Dalindyebo [fifth respondent] is against the processes followed in the kingdom and/or by all royal houses of the abaThembu and will bring serious harm to the kingdom and will continue as long as he occupies the said position. Masualle is accused of failing to provide any reasons for deviating from the Tolo Commission s findings.Cogta s Eastern Cape spokesman, Mamkeli Ngam, was not available for comment yesterday and neither was Masualle s spokesman, Sonwabo Mbananga.Azenathi s spokesman, chief Zwelenqaba Mgudlwa, said he believed Mankunku was wasting his time. What they should just do instead is pay us the outstanding legal costs of their previous application, dismissed last year. What is done is done. Azenathi is the acting king. Eight respondents are listed in the application along with Masualle.They include Cogta MEC Fikile Xasa, Ngangelizwe royal family members, incarcerated Thembu king Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, Azenathi, the Commission on Traditional Leadership Disputes and Claims, Van Rooyen and the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
