More than 1 000 disgruntled residents of Great Kei are today marching to the municipal offices in Komga, to call for Mayor Loyiso Tshetsha&#8217;s head and the entire council to step down. Residents accuse the council of failing to deliver services while the mayor plunders the municipality&#8217;s funds. This was after his driver crashed the mayor&#8217;s state car in December last year, which is now reportedly being fixed at an amount of R500 000 quoted by insurance to be paid from municipal coffers. Among other things residents lamented the poor state of roads in the townships and the poor quality of RDP houses which they say are leaking when it rains. To this end they say all Great Kei councillors must step aside regardless of political affiliation and that a by-election be organised.
