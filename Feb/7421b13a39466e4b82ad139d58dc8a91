He was suspended in December 2016 when the Western Cape High Court ruled that his appointment was unlawful.On Tuesday morning the same court dismissed an appeal against that judgment.The judgment stated the SABC board failed to uphold the constitution and ignored findings by the public protector that he had lied about his qualifications and awarded himself irregular salary hikes.
