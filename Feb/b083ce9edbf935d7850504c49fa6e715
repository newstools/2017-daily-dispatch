Peace has been restored in a seaside village after a disturbed resident who went on the rampage last week was arrested in a three-hour &#8211; long police operation that included a negotiator and a fire &#8211; engine. Gavin Weyer, who terrified neighbours last Thursday when he allegedly t h rew an acidic substance at two men, tossed rocks at cars and hurled bottles and paint onto the street outside his Sunrise-on-Sea house, appeared in court on Monday morning after receiving treatment at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital following his dramatic arrest on Saturday afternoon. Police spokeswoman Hazel Mqala, said a police negotiator was called in when an agitated Weyer clambered onto his roof in-front of curious onlookers. He is due to appear in court on Tuesday for a bail application.
