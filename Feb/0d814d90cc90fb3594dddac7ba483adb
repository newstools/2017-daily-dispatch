Gauteng Premier David Makhura has accepted the resignation of his Health MEC Qedani Mahlanguon over the death of 94 mentally ill patients and promised to improve the care of the surviving patients. Here is his comment in full on the report of the Health Ombudsman on the investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of the patients in Gauteng.On behalf of the Gauteng Provincial Government I hereby welcome the release of the Health Ombudsman Report so that we can the truth about the circumstances surrounding the passing on of mentally ill patients our fellow citizens who were under the care of the Gauteng Department of Health.As the Premier of Gauteng I accept the Report and will fully and urgently implement its recommendations without any reservation or delay. It is clear from the Report that there has been both improper and negligent conduct on the part of officials in the Department of Health in implementation of the policy de-institutionalisation of mental health. As a result many of our beloved citizens have died causing severe pain and anguish among the bereaved families.I deeply regret the tragic loss of so many lives under the care of our provincial government as a result of the action taken by officials in the Gauteng Department of Health to transfer patients from Life Esidimeni to NGOs that were not ready.On 06 December 2016 I made a commitment in the Gauteng Legislature in which I expressed my unhappiness with how the de-institutionalisation was handled. I promised should the investigation find that that was improper conduct or negligence action will be taken to hold those responsible accountable. I also made the same commitment to the affected and bereaved families when I met them on 15 December 2016.I take the improper and negligent actions of our officials in a very serious light that must lead to serious consequences and accountability.
