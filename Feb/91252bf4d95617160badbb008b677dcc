Walter Sisulu University (WSU) students at the Nelson Mandela Drive campus in Mthatha have been evicted by the university. The students were given until 6.30pm on Wednesday to vacate premises after the students torched one of the university buildings.WSU spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo said the university had to ensure the students were removed from campus for the safety of the infrastructure and students.The university yesterday, with the assistance of law enforcement, managed to remove all students from the campus. Today [Thursday] we have been assisted by the law enforcement in evicting everybody in the NMD campus. We are still in negotiations with the SRC and some students are frustrated with the delays, said Tukwayo.The ANC in OR Tambo has since been in consultation with the ANC Youth League that has been leading the strike action on the Mthatha campus.The students torched the Pink House, a recreational facility of the university, at around 3pm on Wednesday after failing to get the management of the university to allow all students to register without NSFAS confirmation for funding and without paying 20% of their existing debt.The university had reached agreement on Tuesday night with the student representative council (SRC) to resume the registration process which was halted for the past four days. However, on Wednesday morning the ANCYL on the Mthatha campus reneged on the agreement and went on a strike.OR Tambo ANC regional chairman and council speaker, Xolile Nkompela told the Daily Dispatch that the ANC in the region was willing to facilitate a conversation between their constituency and the university. Last night we had meaningful and insightful engagements with the students and the management of the institution. We have heard all the points raised by the university and we are sensitive to the plight of the students. However, we need to get to a compromise so that we can ensure the university operations are resumed, said Kompela. simthandilef@dispatch.co.zalSee Opinion page 7
