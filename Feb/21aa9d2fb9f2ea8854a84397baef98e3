Calm has been restored at Walter Sisulu University s Ibika campus after operations were brought to a halt by students demanding, inter alia, that the university resolve a lack of water on campus. Butterworth, where the campus is based, has experienced severe water shortages due to the ongoing drought which has gripped the Amathole District since last year.The district was declared a drought disaster area, with the municipality resorting to water carting to ease the pressure on residents and local businesses.WSU spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo said the university was awaiting grievances from the students and was not fully operational.However, SRC president at the Ibika campus, Zubenathi Sopasi, told the Dispatch they had met with management and resolved some of their grievances.Regarding the lack of water, the university will buy 12 water tanks for students to use.He said after the meetings held on Wednesday, they had resolved to let the registration process continue.
