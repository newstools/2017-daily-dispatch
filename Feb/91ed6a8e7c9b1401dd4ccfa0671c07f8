The National Student Financial Aid Scheme will aid well over 400 000 students on a budget of R15-billion this year. NSFAS chairperson Sizwe Nxasana said in Pretoria on Sunday that 309 788 applications for university and Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) college students had already been approved. Given the completion of some academic year examinations in January 2017 in certain universities there are also more qualifying students whose results are being evaluated which will increase the numbers of funded students said Nxasana. We plan to add more than 100 000 students to the already 309 788 students already funded. Of the total number of applications received 53 043 were unsuccessful while 3 760 were being reviewed.Nxasana also said that 2017 would be the first year that NSFAS would fully roll out a model at universities and TVET colleges which would allow students to apply directly to NSFAS for funding and not have to go through financial aid offices on campus. Students will apply directly to us and we will notify them whether their application was successful or not. One of the benefits is that if they do receive funding the allowance goes directly to students and they manage it themselves he said.
