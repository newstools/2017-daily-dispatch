Arrested Mnquma municipal manager Sindile Tantsi will now appear in Butterworth Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Thursday and not today as previously scheduled. Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said this was because &#8220;specialised investigators working on the fraud and corruption case finished their work late last night. There are still some information we need to verify&#8221;. Mulaudzi said: &#8220;Tomorrow we will still be within the 48 hours limit to arrest and charge a suspect.&#8221; Scores of people clad in ANC regalia are seated in the A-Court of the Butterworth Magistrate&#8217;s Court where Tantsi was supposed to have appeared. The municipal manager was arrested on the N2 road near Mthatha on Tuesday morning. His arrest relates to a R10-million tender Mnquma issued two years ago and subsequent kickbacks.
