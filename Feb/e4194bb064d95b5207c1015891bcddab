Tired of motorists fobbing him off with the excuse that they don t have change a Durban car guard has gone hi-tech and now takes credit card payments. Sabelo Buthelezi a regular outside Love Coffee on Lillian Ngoyi Road in Windermere accepts payments directly into his bank account via the Zapper transaction app. With many people preferring to swipe their cards and use apps to buy beverages Buthelezi was losing out.Zapper business consultant Carmen Worsfold told TMG Digital Buthelezi had approached her after she visited the coffee shop. He asked me about it saying people weren t paying him because everyone was using Zapper she said. We decided to see if we could help. All we did was give him his own QR code which he has on a lanyard around his neck. The code is linked to his personal bank account. Buthelezi of Folweni said he was overjoyed about the change in payment method which he had been using for a week.
