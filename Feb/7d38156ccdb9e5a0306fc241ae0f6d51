The Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries has identified two pesticides it believes will be effective in delivering the country s maize fields from a fall armyworm plague. The voracious larval pest has been identified throughout Limpopo and in northern Gauteng and could ruin the country s entire maize harvest if not contained.The migratory worms native to South and Central America also attack sorghum soybeans groundnuts and potatoes. The department realises that transboundary pests and diseases especially migratory pests threaten food security and that coordinated efforts are important to address these risks Minister Senzeni Zokwana said yesterday.The fall armyworm is new to South Africa meaning no pesticide has been registered for use and proven successful in fighting it.An ongoing emergency process has now registered two pesticides which are likely to work if used correctly. As with all agricultural remedy applications the label instructions must be followed in accordance to the supplier s recommendations Zokwana said.The department is extending its programme to farmers in other provinces with awareness campaigns and further tests for identifying the presence of the worm. Pheromone traps will be imported to determine the exact extent of the spread and the specific strain of fall armyworm present in South Africa. Zokwana urged the nation to remain calm saying that the pesticides identified were safe for use.The department met with the National Treasury earlier yesterday to ask for funding to assist the farming community.It has also started a plant pest action group to evaluate its progress in curbing the worm s spread weekly.Zokwana could not say what the impact of the fall armyworm has been in South Africa thus far but that the department was acting quickly to minimise damage.The worm was positively identified by the department last week though farmers had reported it earlier.Departmental spokeswoman Bomikazi Molapo said the two pesticides cleared for use were readily available to farmers as they were already in use in the country though they were not registered for use against the fall (autumn) armyworm.
