A small &#8211; scale farmer in Keiskammahoek is counting his losses after six cattle including a prized ox were electrocuted yesterday. The area was hit by a storm and the strong winds downed powerlines which later killed the cattle. Peter&#8217;s Farm owner Erol Tonono said the value of the stock is R70 000 with the ox worth R14 000 alone. Tonono said he would like power utility Eskom to compensate him for the loss. I&#8217;m not interested in the meat, I&#8217;m very devastated that my cows were killed. I&#8217;m waiting for a veterinarian to conduct a postmortem to advise me whether the meat would be good to be eaten or whether we should just destroy it. I will submit a claim at Eskom. Tonono claimed he had called Eskom to fix the wires that were still dangling over his field in vain. The wires are live and they are posing a danger to the people and animals. I&#8217;ve asked Eskom to come and fix the lines. They had told me that they had recorded the matter as an emergency and I should wait for a technician to come and fix it in no time. A technician from Bulembu came and inspected the lines and left without notifying anyone , said Tonono. Eskom told me that they have isolated the line therefore the lines were no longer live but we don&#8217;t trust that.
