Sinovuyo Mzongwana turned 20 last week but instead of having a huge party with his friends, he decided to raise funds to buy sanitary towels for schoolgirls. Mzongwana asked his friends to help him raise money to buy 5000 sanitary towels.Currently a pack of 10 sanitary towels could cost anything between R30 and R60 depending on the brand. For girls from poor households, the only option is to use a cloth as some cannot afford to buy sanitary towels.Aware of the need, Mzongwana decided to tell friends they should not buy him gifts for his birthday but, instead, help him with his initiative focused on disadvantaged schools around East London.And this was the start of his #keepagirlinschool sanitary drive.For the full story get a copy of the Dispatch or subscribe to our e-Edition for the complete newspaper with jobs, classifieds, crosswords, TV schedules and back editions.
