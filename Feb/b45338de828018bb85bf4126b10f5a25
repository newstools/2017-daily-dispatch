Sunrise-on-Sea resident Gavin Weyer, who shook up his neighbourhood last week with a frenzied episode at his home, refused psychiatric help during a bail hearing at the East London Magistrate s Court this morning. The hearing was postponed until tomorrow. Weyer told magistrate Nazeem Joemath he would rather go to jail than be held at the psychiatric wing of the West Bank prison. He said he had already received psychiatric help at Cecilia Makiwane H ospital where doctors and nurses had forced him to have an injection and pills. Addressing magistrate Nazeem Joemath, prosecutor Lerato Phakisi read out the charges which consist of two counts of assault with the intention to do grievous bodily harm and one of malicious damage to property. She said the state opposed bail on the grounds that Weyer was of danger to society . See tomorrow&#8217;s edition of the Daily Dispatch for more.
