Miss South Africa Ntandoyenkosi Kunene has not been caught in the UK with cocaine in her possession. The beauty queen and the pageant s organisers have had to issue a denial that she was arrested prompted by a fake report circulating on social media platforms overnight.The report first appeared on the fake website www.te1egraph.co.uk (the real website is www.telegraph.co.uk) under the headline Miss South Africa 2016 arrested at London Heathrow Airport With 2kg of Cocaine . This was subsequently removed but has appeared throughout the day on other fake social media sites.Sun International PR Manager Claudia Henkel said: We chose at first to ignore the reports because we believed that people would realise that it was from a fake site. However in light of the fact that we have had queries from legitimate media outlets we would like to set the record straight. Ntando has not been arrested and she has not been caught with any drugs in her possession. She is currently in South Africa and is not in London; in fact she has never been there.
