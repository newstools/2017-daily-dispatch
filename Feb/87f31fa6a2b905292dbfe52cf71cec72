Thousands of Nehawu members yesterday marched to the Eastern Cape Premier&#8217;s office following the non-filling of vacancies across government departments, outsourcing of government w o rk and a national call to scrap e-tolls. Nehawu provincial secretary Miki Jaceni said although the union was taking part in a national march which was raising national issues, in the Eastern Cape there were unique issues which have been lingering for years. The excessive use of consultants in government departments has effectively compromised the workforce and it has continued to undermine the labour, said Jaceni. The crowd marched from Bhisho sportsfield under the leadership of Jaceni and Nehawu national treasurer Kgomotso Makhupola. Cosatu provincial secretary Xolani Malamleli said the federation was in full support of the march because for it touched on the province s key economic issues . The stance taken by the national government to reduce government organograms by 3% will automatically translate to one staff member having to do three or four jobs at once, said Malamlela.
