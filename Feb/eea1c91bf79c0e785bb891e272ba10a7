It has taken 40 years but an elderly former Eastern Cape farmer has finally been awarded almost R15 million for land he was forced to sell as part of the apartheid government s homeland scheme. Although the courts had finally agreed that Ivor Phillips 82 was forcibly dispossessed of his land without equitable compensation an earlier settlement offer had been withdrawn on the basis that he was white.But following the latest ruling by the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein the way has been paved for the Port Alfred retiree to be awarded R14.78 million in compensation after the National Party government forcibly bought three family farms in 1977 to make way for an independent Ciskei. This case has been a horrendous ordeal for me and my family Phillips said. I am ecstatic that I can finally close this chapter and move on with my life. The payout amount excludes interest and legal costs which could also run into millions of rands of taxpayers money.More in The Herald http://www.heraldlive.co.za/news/2017/02/28/financial-justice-finally-farmer/
