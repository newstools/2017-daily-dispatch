Doctors at a hospital in Boksburg have reported the unusual case of a man who tried to kill himself by injecting mercury into his arms. The 29-year-old arrived at Tambo Memorial Hospital last June 10 weeks after a suicide attempt and x-rays showed the silvery heavy metal in his arms lungs abdomen and pelvis.Writing in the SA Medical Journal Dr Greg Yudelowitz said the man who was experiencing loss of appetite fatigue and occasional diarrhoea was admitted with acute kidney injury . After discussion with the nephrology departments of both Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital Johannesburg and Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town it was decided that no benefit would be derived from dialysis said Yudelowitz.Instead the man faces lifelong treatment with an unregistered drug penicillamine which attracts heavy metals such as mercury and flushes them away in urine.Yudelowitz said an application had been made to the Medicines Control Council for permission to treat the man with the drug.The mercury injections were the third suicide attempt by the man who has bipolar disorder. They followed the loss of his job an accident in which his car was written off and a severe illness endured by his father. He described a history of panic attacks since the age of 20. Further stressors included an experience of date rape at the age of 22 said Yudelowitz.
