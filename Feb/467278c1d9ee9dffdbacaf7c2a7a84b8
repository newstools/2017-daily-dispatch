Walter Sisulu University of Technology s operations were completely shut down yesterday as students protested over the state s student financial aid scheme. WSU spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo confirmed that students from Buffalo City campus and Nelson Mandela campus had removed university staff from the buildings demanding that the university register students who did not have National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSfas) confirmation for funding. The students are trying to force the hand of the university to admit all the students without registration and NSfas guarantee, said Tukwayo. Considering the historical debt of the university that seems to be not going away, the university cannot afford to take in students who will not be able to pay the university. However, WSU s SRC has demanded that the university accept returning students who were rejected by NSfas on the basis of poor academic performance.The SRC also wants the university to allow students from no-fee schools to register without NSfas confirmation.Although there is now provision for no-fee matriculants to register with the university using NSfas funds, for this to happen they have to apply for the funds the year before.University of South Africa spokesman Mateboho Green announced this week that NSfas had made a commitment to all first-entry students who applied for financial aid.He said students coming from underprivileged schools and homes that were dependent on grants would qualify for financial aid. These students may, with minimal risk to universities, be admitted to the study programme for which they qualify, subject to availability of space, and also to a place of residence, said Green.Tukwayo said although WSU acknowledged the commitment by NSfas to the no-fee paying former pupils, the protesting students had not applied in time.The total number of students that will receive NSfas grants this year is estimated to be 235000, up from the 176000 students who were funded in 2016.Buffalo City campus SRC President Luyanda Mgomba said they had communicated to NSfas that the majority of students from no-fee schools had limited access to the internet.She said some of those students rejected by NSfas last year had supplementary examinations and had since passed, allowing them to qualify. The university should effect such adjustments to these students, said Mgomba. simthandilef@dispatch.co.za
