Gospel singer Deborah Fraser has been applauded by the gay community after giving a shout-out at Lundi Tyamara s memorial service at the Grace Bible Church in Soweto. Deborah who was one of Lundi s mentors told the packed church hall that she had nothing but love for gay people. All you gay people I love you because you are loving you are so supportive she said. Deborah s comments come just over a week since TV personality Somizi Mhlongo stormed out of the same church after feeling discriminated against .This after visiting pastor Bishop Dag Heward-Mills labelled homosexuality as disgusting and sinful .The Somizi and Grace Bible Church debacle sparked widespread outrage amongst the LGBT community which led to protests outside the church on Sunday.
