The troubled Sunrise-on-Sea man who disrupted his neighbourhood last week, turned down the opportunity of being represented by top attorney Neil Ristow in the East London Magistrate&#8217;s Court yesterday and then chose to stay in prison rather that apply for bail. Gavin Weyer, 48, has been charged with two counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and one of malicious damage to property.The charges stem from last Thursday when Weyer allegedly went on an unhinged rampage at his double-storey house which is covered with bizarre graffiti and which he allegedly set fire to three months ago. Once proceedings got underway, the accused was unable to follow court procedures, made inappropriate interjections and informed magistrate Nazeem Joemath he did not want another postponement. The tortuous proceedings ended with the accused opting to forgo the bail application. It s better that I stay in jail because if I leave I will be harmed. Joemath instructed Weyer be kept in the psychiatric wing of West Bank Prison until his next appearance on April 6. barbarh@dispatch.co.za
