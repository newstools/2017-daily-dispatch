Cradock taps have suddenly run dr y . The town, which falls under the Chris Hani District Municipality, suddenly had its water supply cut off on Wednesday. Municipality spokeswoman Thobeka Mqamelo said the water cuts were caused by dirt blocking rain water from reaching the water treatment stations. A raw water pump blockage caused by constant concentration of debris from recent rains. This has affected raw water flow into the water treatment works, causing total water shut down, she said. Mqamelo said the municipality had worked overnight to restore water supply in the K aroo town. She said the dirt had been cleaned up but water would only be fully restored tomorrow (Friday). Filling the reservoirs to normal levels for water to be pumped out to the residents will take longer as they stood at 0% when pumping resumed. We expect supply to be back at about 3pm today in low &#8211; lying areas and tomorrow in the high &#8211; lying areas , she said The municipality has deployed trucks to deliver water in the area until water is restored in the municipality.
