A luxury Sunshine Coast game reserve has been ordered to pay 11 housekeepers token damages of R45 000 each after they were subjected to a strip search when money went missing from a tourist chalet. Grahamstown regional court magistrate Arno Strydom on Friday also ordered upmarket Kariega Game Reserve to offer &#8220;specialist trauma counselling&#8221; to the women and get expert training for security staff involved in searches. The women were collectively suing Kariega for more than R4 &#8211; million claiming they were sexually assaulted and violated by reserve catering manager Adriana Adri Pienaar after R200 and an undisclosed amount of e uros went missing from two locked lodges when visitors were out on a day drive. Strydom&#8217;s judgment also ordered Kariega to &#8220;present sensitisation training&#8221; to all employees on the relevant provisions of the South African constitution and human rights when it came to searches in the workplace.
