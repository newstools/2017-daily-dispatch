Two motorists were burnt beyond recognition when their vehicles collided on the N2 near Chintsa this morning. The N2 road remains closed because investigators from various specialised units are still working the scene. Motorists headed from East London towards Butterworth and those from Butterworth sides towards East London have been stranded. Some are gathering nearby to watch officials work the scene. The accident is suspected to have taken place shortly after 7am. The accident was between a Renault Sandero and a Mitsubishi Colt bakkie. There were no passengers on the vehicles.
