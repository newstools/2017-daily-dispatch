Contralesa Eastern Cape has distanced itself from the formation of a new political party in which some of its national leaders are involved. Provincial chairman Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana said the organisation remained apolitical . He also said President Chief Setlamarogo Thobejane s resignation as an ANC MP was personal and has nothing to do with Contralesa . His resignation is linked to the formation of a new political party named African Restoration Party. We had hoped that (Contralesa) national leadership would correct this and clarify the reports to distance our organisation from the resignation of (Thobejane) from p arliament and the involvement of Contralesa in the formation of the envisaged political party. Contralesa has nothing to do with the African Restoration Party. Contralesa remains a progressive organisation of all traditional leaders and above party politics, said Nonkonyana. He said the Contralesa general council had , at a January 28 meeting , expressed disappointment at leaders who had involved themselves in the formation of the new party. They promised to withdraw their participation and issue a public statement to that effect, but have yet to do so , said Nonkonyana.
