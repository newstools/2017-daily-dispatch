Transport Minister Dipuo Peters has issued notices of intent to dismiss four Airports Company SA (Acsa) board members in a move seen as an attempt to shield CEO Bongani Maseko from being suspended and disciplined for flouting the parastatal s supply chain rules. The notices were issued late on Friday with a shareholder meeting scheduled to take place next Monday.The affected board members are nonexecutive directors John Lamola McDonald Kenosi Moroka Chwayita Mabude and Bajabulile Luthuli.Peters is said to have caught the board off guard as some of the suspended members were due to meet with her to discuss a board resolution to suspend Maseko with immediate effect and to start instituting a disciplinary process against him. That board resolution was still to be ratified said sources who asked not to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media.The development follows a series of meetings at which the crisis-hit Acsa s board discussed extending the suspensions of senior executives who have also been implicated in flouting the parastatal s supply chain rules.Full story here: https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/companies/transport-and-tourism/2017-02-13-minister-moves-to-fire-acsa-board-members/
