Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has called on leaders to refrain from inciting violence after violent protests in Rosettenville Johannesburg in which at least 12 houses were torched. Our purpose is to ensure that we highlight the importance for leaders to be measured in their public pronouncements. It could very well make one popular to say irresponsible statements that could incite vandalism that could incite South African communities to take the law into their own hands said Gigaba.He was speaking at a meeting with senior officials at the Yeoville police station on safety and security issues and on how to contain the public violence and prevent it from spreading to other areas.Among those attending the meeting were Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane and Provincial Police Commissioner Deliwe de Lange. Leaders have a responsibility at all times to be measured in their public pronouncements considering the fact that as a result of what you say there could be lives that are lost there could be property that could be destroyed which belongs to private individuals and they would have invested enormously in the development and maintenance of that property Gigaba said.Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba said on Friday it was unfortunate that Rosettenville residents were accusing him of inciting violence in the area when he was only trying to diffuse it.At least 12 houses were torched during another weekend of violence after residents claimed the houses were being used as drug dens and brothels.Mashaba has been accused of inciting the violence after his comments on illegal immigrants but he says it s not his fault.
