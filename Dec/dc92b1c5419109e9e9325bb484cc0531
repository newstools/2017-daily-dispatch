The rand was weaker against major global currencies in volatile trade on Monday just before midday‚ driven by sentiment emanating from the ANC conference in Nasrec in Johannesburg. The market is closely watching the outcome of the conference‚ where ANC MP Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa are contesting the party’s leadership.
