Mthatha traffic chief Vuyisile Magangana miraculously survived a horrific accident on the Kei Bridge this evening after his state vehicle was involved in a head-on collision. The accident, which brought traffic to a standstill, took place around 7pm. According to the Eastern Cape provincial traffic deputy director Charles Bramwell, the accident was caused by another vehicle which drove on the wrong side of the road before plunging into Magangana’s car. “Magangana was driving from East London while a vehicle driving from Butterworth hit a side barrier and veered all over the road before coming to the wrong lane and collided with our official vehicle,” said Bramwell, adding that no one was killed in the accident.
