A bruising church leadership battle comes to an end this weekend when Bishop Hummingfield Charles Nkosinathi Ndwandwe is enthroned as the new bishop of the Anglican Church of Southern Africa’s Mthatha Diocese. A gruelling three-way race was marred by one contender, archdeacon and former vicar-general Reverend Mcebisi Pinyana, admitting he had falsified his masters and PhD academic qualifications. Anglican Archbishop Thabo Makgoba condemned the experience as regrettable but forgave Pinyana, saying that the “church was full of broken human beings” like everyone, “and in need of God’s redemptive love all the time”. Ndwandwe will be enthroned in a colourful service to be officiated by the church’s Southern Africa head, the Archbishop Thabo Makgoba, at the Cathedral in Mthatha at 9am today. This comes after Bishop Sithembele Mzamane, who had been in charge of this diocese for 17 years, retired in March. — lulamilef@dispatch.co.za A charred wooden cross and blackened walls are all that remain of a church gutted by fire.
