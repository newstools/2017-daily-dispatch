The march started at Cecilia Makiwane and ended at Nkqubela TB Hospital.Dyantyi, who was meant to have led the crowd, was instead chauffeured from Cecilia Makiwane to the TB hospital in her luxury Audi Q7, and met the crowd at the gate of the TB hospital.Speaking to Saturday Dispatch at the start of the march, the MEC said the event formed part of a dialogue programme that the national Department of Health had recommended to provinces. The department had recommended that we hold dialogues around TB. Also, if we want to achieve the 90-90 targets set by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on TB, we need to involve the public, said Dyantyi.For the full story get a copy of the Dispatch or subscribe to our e-Edition for the complete newspaper with jobs, classifieds, crosswords, TV schedules and back editions.
