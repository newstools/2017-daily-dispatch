The Constitutional Court on Friday ordered that Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) and the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) continue its invalid contract for a period of 12 months. CPS has to continue paying grants Justice Johan Froneman said.Rights group Black Sash approached the Constitutional Court earlier this month seeking an order for the court to supervise any future contract to distribute social grants.The current contract between CPS and the Sassa expires at the end of this month.The contract was ruled illegal by the Constitutional Court in 2014 but CPS was allowed to continue distributing grants while Sassa found a replacement.Sassa told the court in 2015 it would take over the payment of grants itself when the CPS contract expires.But the government agency has since said it is not equipped to distribute grants.
