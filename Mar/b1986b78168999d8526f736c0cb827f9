Judgement will be handed down in the social grants matter this morning. Black Sash brought the case and asked the Constitutional Court to supervise the payment of social grants to ensure they are paid on April 1.This is after Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini failed to ensure there was a company in place to distribute grants when the contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) expires at the end of the month.She also failed to ensure Sassa would pay the grants themselves as they had promised the court in November 2015.CPS CEO Serge Belamant said he wanted judgment this week so that payments could be made on time as it took 12 working days to pay grants.The court will decide whether to extend the invalid contract between Sassa and CPS or create a new one.The court is likely to give instructions on how a new tender process should work to find a legal distributor of grants.
