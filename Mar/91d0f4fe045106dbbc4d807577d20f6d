The computers that were stolen at the chief justice s office contain sensitive and confidential information that has led to one of the judge s house being broken into shortly after the burglary. This is according to Captain David Moody whose affidavit was read out in the Randburg Magistrate s Court during Nkosinathi Msimango s bail application on Friday.Msimango is facing charge of theft and housebreaking with intent to steal in connection with the burglary at the office of the Chief Justice that took place two weeks ago.Moody said the computers contain information pertaining to financial reports addresses of judges and salaries. Further investigations [show] that the accused had a telephonic conversation with witnesses regarding a sale of computers. One of the judges whose details are contained in the computers was robbed at his residential address. Moody said the safety of the judges was compromised as a result of the burglary.He asked the court to deny Msimango bail as he was likely to evade his trial. The accused knew the police were looking for him but he evaded arrest. It is likely that he will be sentenced to direct imprisonment if found guilty. Moody said that Msimango has connections with people who can make fictitious documents as one of the men arrested in connection with the same case was allegedly found with fake identity documents. The state is aware that the accused has rights but his rights are outweighed by the value of the information contained in the computers Moody s affidavit reads.Moody added that Msimango s release would cause a public outcry. The motive of the theft of the computers is unknown except that a judge s house was broken into. According to Moody more arrests are imminent and the police were analysing video footage and waiting for DNA and fingerprint results.The bail application continues.
