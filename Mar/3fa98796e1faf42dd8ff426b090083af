Struggle veteran Ahmed Kathrada had expressed that he did not want to be placed on life support his foundation revealed on Tuesday. His wish was honoured said executive director of the foundation Neeshan Balton.Kathrada died at 03.45 on Tuesday morning at the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre in Johannesburg.Balton said those close to him had not anticipated that the struggle icon would die from the illness that ultimately took his life. He said they were caught by surprise when Kathrada fell ill. We thought he was fine was recovering very well until dehydration kicked in he said but that was when doctors picked up the large clot on the left side of his brain. The one thing about Comrade Kathy even in that condition he wanted to consult said Balton adding that Kathrada continued to have meetings from his hospital bed.Balton said Kathrada was a man of integrity who refused to be drawn into the private sector. I can say he never served on any board. He didn t have shares in any particular company. He declined every board position because he could not add value to the corporate world Many others would have acted differently he said.Many of Kathrada s friends and family visited him at the Donald Gordon Medical Centre on Monday when news broke that he had taken a turn for the worse.Balton said Kathrada had given strict instructions to never be placed on life support.
