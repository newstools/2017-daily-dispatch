Protesting University of Fort Hare (UFH) students have called their newly appointed vice-chancellor (VC) a liar and an ignorant VC . The angry students were speaking at a gathering at the East London campus today where the newly elected VC, Sakhela Buhlungu was responding to their memorandum of demands. The students boycotted classes on Wednesday in protest over unresolved issues. He [Buhlungu] does not relate to the struggle of black students, he thinks this is UCT (University of Cape Town) w h ere he served as a mere Dean. Here at UFH we do not operate like that if we call you to address us, you come, said the students.
