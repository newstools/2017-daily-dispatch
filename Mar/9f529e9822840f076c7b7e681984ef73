President Jacob Zuma has ordered the Hawks to investigate serious allegations of corruption in the Eastern Cape department of social development. In a presidential statement released by Zuma s spokesman, Dr Bongani Ngqulunga, it was announced that the Special Investigating Unit would investigate:lSerious maladministration in the affairs of the department, especially improper or unlawful conduct by councillors, officials or employees of the department;lUnlawful appropriation or expenditure of public money or property;lUnlawful, irregular or unapproved acquisitive acts, transactions, measures or practices having a bearing upon state property;lIntentional or negligent loss of public money or damage to public property;lUnlawful conduct or improper conduct by any person, which has caused or may cause serious harm to the interests of the public;lProcurement of goods, works or services on behalf of the department and payments made in a manner that was not fair, uncompetitive, not transparent nor cost-effective.It is not clear in the report which financial years the SIU will be focusing on, but in recent years the department has been embroiled in a number of money scandals.In 2011-12 an Eastern Cape government report revealed that the department spent R32-million on subsistence and travelling and R14-million on printing, venues and catering . The department also moved into their current Beacon Hill building without a signed lease.The then-MEC Nonkosi Mvana and senior official Nozuko Yokwana confirmed they didn t understand why they had to rush to occupy an unfinished building. They said they were forced to move into the building.Mvana pointed fingers at Pemmy Majodina, at that time the incoming MEC of social development, saying when she took over things changed and they moved there (to Beacon Hill) . Mvana claimed Majodina knew the reasons for the move.In 2014, the department s new MEC, Nancy Sihlwayi, was accused of disrespecting the public purse by using state money to transport ANC Women s League veterans to a state event in the Free State. At the time, the department s HOD Stanley Khanyile said the department spent R44200 on the Free State jaunt.Recently the department spent R38460274 to build a centre in Port Elizabeth and the transaction was identified as irregular expenditure by the auditor-general as, among other things, some sub-contractors did not qualify to build the structure.Departmental spokesman Mzukisi Solani said: This move will assist the department to investigate serious maladministration in connection with the affairs of the department. bonganif@dispatch.co.za
