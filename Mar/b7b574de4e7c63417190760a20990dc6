By Mamela Gowa and Mike LoeweThe strike by members of Samwu is over and water has been turned back on in Buffalo City Metro. Amatola Water s acting chief executive, Kevin Govindsamy, said yesterday that the water supply was back to optimum levels and operations were back to normal. The only area still being affected is King William s Town where supply will be restored within next 72 hours. Sixty Samwu workers had been on a two-day unprotected strike which affected water supply to some areas of Buffalo City, he said. After earnest discussions with the Samwu legal representatives, the union agreed to end the strike and that workers would return to their posts today. Feedback from our sites confirms that employees have honoured this agreement and are back at work, he said.He said that in some cases, damage had been done to some of the utility s assets such as equipment and vehicles.In these cases, Amatola Water would lay charges with the police.Govindsamy said Amatola Water was continuing with investigations to address the issues which had given rise to the strike.Several issues, which required further investigation, had been highlighted by an internal audit, followed by a ministerial task team report.The ministerial report was handed over to Amatola Water last month for further action.Samwu s Amathole regional chairman, Skumbuzo Roji, confirmed yesterday they had called off the strike on Wednesday and had returned to work.They went on strike after a full-time shop steward, Victor Totolo, was suspended last Friday.He added that negotiations were ongoing and they were still in a dark position .Despite the strike being called off, residents from Mdantsane and business owners in Zwelitsha and Bhisho complained that they had no water yesterday.BCM communications officer Bathandwa Diamond said on Wednesday that although the syphon failure at the Laing Water Treatment Works (WTW) and strike had been resolved on Wednesday the system would l take at least five days to recover in the urban areas and may take up to 10 days in rural areas. This means the affected areas will be without water for the next two days. However, pressure will start to recover to full capacity on Friday [today]. Buffalo City Metro will dispatch at least 15 water tankers and 15 Jojo tanks to assist with temporary water supply in the affected areas, Diamond said.Other affected areas were Berlin, Ilitha, Ndevana, Phakamisa, Schornville, Nkqonqweni and Newlands villages. mamelag@dispatch.co.za / mikel@dispatch.co.za
