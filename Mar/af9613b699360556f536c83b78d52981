The world-renowned Royal Moscow Ballet brought 12 of its ballet dancers to grace South African stages with enchanting dances as they performed three acts in tribute to great Russian composers.The company consists of graduates from the best Russian choreography schools.Royal Moscow Ballet has toured successfully around the globe and countries visited include Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, France, Austria, Sweden, the US, the UK, Canada, Germany, Finland, India, Switzerland, China, Israel, Japan and Mexico.Since its founding, the Royal Moscow Ballet has given more than 100 performances.Production director Edouard Miasnikov said the team was excited about being in East London and sharing the different acts which were danced to music composed by Sergei Rachmaninov, Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Aleksander Borodin, composers the tour is currently honouring. The first act of the programme, Paganini, accompanied by a musical score by Rachmaninov, is based on the memoirs, life and creative ideas of the musician, Miasnikov said. Tchaikovsky s Nutcracker stands alone as an artistic phenomenon, a symphony about childhood, while Aleksander Borodin is honoured through Polovtsian dances. The show started in Johannesburg on March 4 and will be concluding in Port Elizabeth on March 18 before heading to Gaborone.Misanikov said the production would return to South Africa in August to pay tribute to male ballet dancers of the 20th century. mbalit@dispatch.co.za
