The SABC dropped a bombshell late last night with its 2015/2016 annual report and it s a big deal. In Cape Town today the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) is taking the SABC s executives to task as they ask the difficult questions.Here are five things you need to know:1. Hlaudi s salary: According to the financial statements former Chief Operating Officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng earned R4.1-million. Broken down this is a R2.5-m basic salary a 13th cheque of R213 000 expenses and other allowances of R945 000 and employers contribution to medical aid and pension funds of R485 000.2. Irregular spending: The auditor general found a total of R5.1-billion in irregular wasteful and fruitless expenditure. Yes R5.1-billion. It s all very complicated but it s an accumulation of money spent without following correct policies and procedures in 2015 and 2016.Here s a breakdown of how that money was spent:* Payments without a contract in place R40.9m (compared to R13.4m in 2015);* Procurement processes not followed R16.2m (down from R62.9m last year);* No original tax certificate at date of award R142.3m (down from R308.9m in 2015) and;* Inadequate monitoring of contracts/split orders R225.9m (up from just R822 000 in 2015).3. Losing it: The SABC group filed a total loss of R411.6-m by the end of March 2016 compared to a loss of R131 370-m for the same period the previous year.4. Big bucks: The largest amount listed under expenditures is for employee and directors compensation and benefit expenses which totaled R3.2-billion out of a R7.9-billion total revenue. It cost the SABC more than R1-billion to collect this revenue.5. Criminals at the SABC?: According to MP s who were asking some difficult questions of the SABC executives the Auditor General s report found the SABC had no idea which of it s employees had criminal records.
