Troubled Mnquma municipal manager Sindile Tantsi has been placed on special leave for the remainder of his contract which lapses in September. Tantsi&#8217;s special leave will be in place until his contract ends , or pending the finalisation of his court case. He was arrested last month by the Hawks for various alleged financial irregularities at the council. It is unlikely that his case will be concluded before September, meaning that the municipal manager &#8211; who has since been charged with fraud and corruption in relation to, among other matters , a R10-million black plastic bag tender &#8211; will not be returning to his more than R1-million-a-year job. However he will continue to receive his salary in the interim. Tantsi was informed of the decision i n a letter by mayor Thobeka Bikitsha, dated February 20 .
