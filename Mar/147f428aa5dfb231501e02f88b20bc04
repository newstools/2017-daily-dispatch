The Southern Africa Litigation Centre (SALC) has been granted permission by the International Criminal Court to make submissions on the court s inquiry into South Africa s non-compliance with its obligations. The ICC decided to convene a hearing on April 7 to discuss whether to find South Africa guilty of not complying with its request to arrest and surrender Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir.The centre asked the court earlier this year to make submissions to the ICC inquiry and the court granted the request last week.Kaajal Ramjathan-Keogh executive director of the SALC made this announcement at a media briefing on Wednesday convened by the International Commission of Jurists who announced that it had made submissions to South Africa s parliament calling on the country to stay in the ICC.The parliamentary portfolio committee on justice and correctional services had called for submissions on the Implementation of the International Criminal Court Act Repeal Bill.South Africa as a signatory to the Rome Statute had a duty to arrest and surrender Al-Bashir to the ICC when he visited the country during an African Union Summit in June 2015.However the country did not and South Africa notified the United Nations of its intention to withdraw from the Rome Statute in October last year.However South Africa on Tuesday revoked its notice to withdraw following a high court judgment in Pretoria which held that the decision to withdraw should have been taken by parliament not the executive.Ramjathan-Keogh said the SALC had also made submissions to the committee.In its submissions the centre said the Repeal Bill was drafted as a result of an executive decision to withdraw from the Rome Statute which the court last month declared invalid. The Repeal Bill as a result must also be invalid. ? This story has been corrected to reflect that the Southern Africa Litigation Centre sought leave to make submissions before the ICC . The centre did not ask the ICC to make a ruling on South Africa s failure to arrest Al Bashir. It also reflects the correct spelling of the Southern Africa Litigation Centre.
