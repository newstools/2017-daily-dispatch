Academic programme has been disrupted at the University of Fort Hare&#8217;s East London campus this morning. Students are now gathered in front of the campus where they are expected to deliver a memorandum to the university management. In a mass meeting that was held at the institution&#8217;s campus yesterday, students agreed not to return to class until their demands were met. Among the list of demands are: 1. The implementation of shuttle services; 2. The allocation of food and book allowance with immediate effect; 3. The compensation of laptops that were lost because of weak security system at the Union Arcade residence; and 4. Reimbursement of the money that was overcharged students in the previous year at residence.SRC campus secretary Dineo Selemesa confirmed to the Dispatch that no classes took place today. &#8220;Even tests there were supposed to be written were not written. Students gathered here to submit the memorandum to the management,&#8221; she said. In an email issued to students by the university s chief information officer, Christian Johl, the management had agreed to receiving the memorandum, &#8220;however, handing over of the memorandum of grievances does not suggest that the academic activities are suspended or that they must be disrupted. The university remains open. Classes have not been suspended . He also urged members of staff to be in class as required and that the library be open and that all other academic activities continue as planned. &#8220;Additional security have been deployed to monitor the situation and to deal with elements that are disrupting the academic activities,&#8221; he said. He said the management would do everything in its power to ensure that the right of students to be in class is protected and that the staff members were not intimidated whatever the grievances were.
