Mkhwebane s office confirmed to Business Day on Sunday that she would be investigating the matter after the DA requested the probe.Public Protector spokesman Oupa Segalwe said this would form part of Mkhwebane s own-initiative investigation into the maladministration of the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) grants matter which dealt with the apparent undue delay in implementing the 2014 Constitutional Court judgment that found the CPS contract was invalid. Regarding the own-initiative probe advocate Mkhwebane already wrote to the ministers and directors-general of social development and finance two weeks back to bring to their attention her intention to investigate Segalwe said.&#8211; TMG Digital/BusinessLIVEFull story at BusinessLIVE http://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2017-03-20-public-protector-to-probe-cpss-ties-to-bathabile-dlamini/
