I have a close friend a young man who always listens when I speak and he will phone me if I say something wrong Dlamini said. He called me on Tuesday and told me I had missed an important opportunity to say sorry. The first thing I was supposed to do is to apologise to South Africans. And I thought that was profound. I also want to again repeat I am so sorry.
