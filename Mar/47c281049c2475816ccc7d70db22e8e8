A decision on whether Western Cape Premier Helen Zille s tweets about colonialism will be the topic of a public debate will be made on Wednesday. The speaker of the Western Cape legislature Sharna Fernandez said she would make the decision after meeting her senior team which includes deputy speaker Piet Pretorius.The leader of the opposition in the legislature acting ANC provincial chairman Khaya Magaxa wrote to Fernandez on Monday asking for an urgent debate on Zille s tweets.But Fernandez said any snap debate had to be on a pressing matter. It has to be considered something like a disaster. Something huge that affects the lives of many people and that would require an immediate decision to be made. Magaxa said Zille s tweets were part her campaign to attack people of colour insult citizens smooth over colonialism renege on her oath to uphold the constitution &#8230; and embarrass our legislature province and country .Last Thursday Magaxa tried to question Zille about the tweets during a committee meeting but she declined saying it was not the correct platform.The tweets have landed Zille in trouble with the DA which is investigating her with a view to an internal disciplinary process.TMG Digital/TimesLIVE
