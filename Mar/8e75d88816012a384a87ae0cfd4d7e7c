(@JusFeez) March 8, 2017As usual Twitter CSI attempted to investigate the crime and we know by now they never come up empty-ended.Their findings would not be helpful to the actual case but they found suspects and one of the names that popped up was Maps Maponyane.Twitter detectives should take over the case! I am pretty sure they will get to the bottom of this #ORTamboRobbery&mdash; Kgaugelo Masweneng (@KgaugeloKgaphol) March 9, 2017Maps tweeted that he had a big night ahead on the day of the heist and later tweeted to thank tweeps who had wished him luck. Of course he was not talking about the heist but Twitter detectives put his tweet and the timing of the heist together.The TV star laughed off Twitter detectives insinuations and played along asking followers how much money they wanted. pic.twitter.com/ZHIyER7fQE&mdash; The Analyst (@KabeloNgwane) March 8, 2017 https://t.co/UPsLeAP44i&mdash; Maps Maponyane (@MapsMaponyane) March 8, 2017Eish, okay fine ke!
