Hundreds of land claimants in Mthatha erupted in celebration with women ululating and men dancing when the government handed over R27.4-million in compensation for land they were forcefully removed from 63 years ago. They said they never thought their ancestors 6013 hectares would eventually be restored to their offspring.The land was taken for the establishment of the Langeni forestry plantation through removals in 1954 and again in 1964.On Monday, Khanyisile Ndzungu, 60, whose grandfather Jongilanga Ndzungu was head of a family forcefully removed from Qelana village, discharged himself from hospital to come and celebrate with hundreds of other claimants at KwaTshemese village near Mthatha.Ndzungu, the Qelana land claim committee chairman, whose late father Tempile Kaizer Ndzungu lodged the community claim 19 years ago in November 1998, lamented that some of his committee members and other claimants had died.
