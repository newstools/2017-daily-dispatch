Western Cape Premier Helen Zille has sparked anger on social media by saying that colonialism wasn t all bad. For those claiming legacy of colonialism was ONLY negative think of our independent judiciary transport infrastructure piped water etc Zille said on Twitter on Thursday.But one of her party members Mbali Ntuli who has on several occasions called her out on her opinions and tweets disagreed with her. It was ONLY negative!! Colonialism=development argument is trash as those subjugated can attest to (sic) replied Ntuli.Ntuli is former DA youth leader and she is currently an MPL at the KwaZulu-Natal legislature. It s like saying Nazism was good for German democracy and their advancements in technology added Ntuli.But Zille replying to another twitter user @GrahamDowns said: I do not know what positive Hitler produced. He stoked up nationalism and authoritarianism and genocide and destruction. @Lazola Ndamase said: The judicial system is colonial hence it sends blacks to jail &amp; leaves land thieves &amp; apartheid murderers untouched. @NomalangaSA also responded: Im sure next youll tell Jews to look at the positive side of Nazi Germany&#8230; we cant trust you ma m (sic). @Kobbibrwn was not as polite saying thats f*ck*d up helen. whats good infrastructure gon do for me when im oppressed (sic). But Zille hit back: Do you think life would be better without infrastructure?
