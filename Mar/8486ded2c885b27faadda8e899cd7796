A former East London man s passion for coffee which led him to develop what he claims to be the strongest coffee in the world, is now available at the world s largest online shopping website. Sean Kristafor, 45, who was schooled at Hudson Park High School and UCT before working in retail in East London and becoming the general manager of The Body Shop southern Africa, made the leap into entrepreneurship last year when he launched The Black Insomnia Coffee Company in Cape Town in July.By October the coffee was being distributed to 42 countries and in January Kristafor was selling to American coffee lovers out of a distribution centre in Tampa, Florida.As from last week, his toecurling blend using the caffeinepacked robusta coffee bean, became available on the Amazon online retail site, meaning Americans can now buy his coffee, which he says borders on [a] narcotic , at the click of a button.In a month s time, the brand will be selling on Amazon Prime so that Europe, the UK and Australia will be able to purchase it online. The weird thing is that I wanted to retire at the end of 2015 and started the coffee company as a hobby to keep me busy, said Kristafor, who operates his global business from a range of coffee shops in Cape Town. I thought two or three coffee shops would stock it, but it s taken off and we even sell merchandise like hoodies, T-shirts and mugs, so it s become a lifestyle brand. A fragrance which will not smell like coffee is also on the cards.To prove his claim that his is the strongest coffee on the globe, Kristafor, has gone to a lot of trouble.He sent samples of two other coffees who claim to be the world s fiercest to a laboratory and claims his brew beat them both.Just one cup almost fulfills the daily maximum intake of caffeine per day, so this is not a beverage to quaff mindlessly, although Kristafor chooses to ignore this warning. But I never drink it after noon because then I would not get any sleep.
