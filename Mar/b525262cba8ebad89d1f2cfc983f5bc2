The spate of well-organised Bonnie Doon break-ins continued this weekend with two households convinced they were hit by a syndicate which observed them leaving their homes before plundering them. One of the two robberies took place in Lower Ridge Road bringing the total of burglaries in the road &#8211; which starts as Norwood Avenue &#8211; to four since January 27. Burglar bars in both homes were simply yanked off by the burglars who have a fine taste in jewellery and perfume and who sorted through the contents of dressing tables, leaving cheaper versions behind.
