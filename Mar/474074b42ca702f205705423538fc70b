This slideshow requires JavaScript.The incident occurred just after 8pm on Monday, when two adults and a toddler travelling in a Renault Clio stopped at a stop sign in Fort Jackson and were bashed by a police bakkie from behind.Vehicle owner Noxolo Yekela, who was driving the Clio with her mother and five-year-old daughter in the back seat, said it could have been a lot worse for them. The police bakkie came at high impact speed, to such an extent it moved my car from the stop sign to the white line in the middle of the road, she said. My biggest concern was my daughter who was seated in the back seat. Yekela said the police officer driver of the state vehicle, who appeared to be drunk, fled the scene. Fortunately the police vehicle was branded and it was labelled Buffalo Flats CSC, which made it easy for us to identify and we called the station to alert them to what had happened. Eventually they arrived to assess the scene. Police spokeswoman Hazel Mqala confirmed the incident. An on-duty police officer was dispatched to the scene and found the police vehicle unattended after crashing into a light motor vehicle, said Mqala. The police officer driving the vehicle was nowhere to be found which is why we cannot confirm whether or not he had been drunk at the time. Mqala said that according to a vehicle register the policeman was on duty at the time but had since taken some days off due to the shock of the accident.
