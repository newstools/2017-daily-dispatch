Students at the University of Fort Hare have boycotted classes to demand that newly appointed vice-chancellor Professor Sakhela Buhlungu resolve some outstanding issues. They want him to resolve issues initially raised with former VC Dr Mvuyo Tom.East London campus SRC premier Sonwabiso Mamkeli said the students were fed up with empty promises and wanted implementation of what Tom agreed to. These include the allocation of food and book allowances for students, provision of shuttle services and insourcing of security and cleaning. [Yesterday] we were sup-posed to hand over a memorandum to the university management, but the students demanded that the VC should come to receive the memorandum himself. He has agreed to meet with the students [today], he said.Mamkeli said students vowed not to return to classes until all their demands were met. Students made it clear that they are not going back to class until they see the implementation of their grievances. Students are tired of the promises the university makes and does not bother to honour. Yesterday, hundreds of students demonstrated outside their East London campus.Among the list of demands were:lCompensation for laptops lost because of weak security at the Union Arcade residence;lImmediate reimbursement of money overcharged in previous years at the residences;lImplementation of in-sourcing of security guards and cleaners; andlThe extension of course cancellation and additions.In an e-mail to students and staff, the university s chief information officer Christian Johl yesterday said management had agreed to receive the memorandum. However handing over of the memorandum of grievances does not suggest that academic activities are suspended or that they must be disrupted. The university remains open. Classes have not been suspended. He urged staff members to be in class as required, that the library remain open and that all other academic activities continue as planned. sinom@dispatch.co.za
