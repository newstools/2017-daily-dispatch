In addition to the above revelation the nurse also had a go at the president saying that she wished it had been Zuma who was in hospital dying of a heart attack .Hospital management was alarmed by the post at the weekend which referred to Zuma s wife number four . The employee in question has not only defied a code of practice adhered to throughout the healthcare world she has also blatantly contravened legislation and our company policies and has behaved in a manner completely contrary to our values by breaching the sanctity of the commitment to maintain confidential all details about any patient hospital manager Louis Vanderhoven said in a statement to the newspaper.
