Boycott of classes by the University of Fort Hare&#8217;s East London campus students has entered its second day this morning. Hundreds of students are currently gathered outside the campus waiting for the newly appointed vice-chancellor, Sakhela Buhlungu to receive their memorandum of grievances. Most of the issues in the memorandum are issues that the previous vice-chancellor Mvuyo Tom promised to resolve. Last year, academic programmes were disrupted as students at both East London and Alice campuses boycotted classes for almost a month demanding that the same issues they are raising now be met. They only returned to classes just a few weeks before the final examination after Tom promised to implement all that was contained in the memorandum. However, it appears as if none or most of their demands were never met. At this moment it remains to be seen when students will return to classes. On a mass meeting held on Tuesday, students agreed to boycott classes. Campus secretary Dineo Selemela said they were not sure when the students would return to classes. We are here to submit the memorandum to the VC, students will decide of a way forward afterwards. Among the list of their demands: 1. The implementation of shuttle services ; 2. The allocation of food and book allowance with immediate effect ; 3. The compensation of laptops that were lost because of weak security system at the Union Arcade residence ; and 4. Reimbursement of the money that was overcharged to students in previous year at residence. Police are monitoring the situation.
