Unemployed graduates in the Eastern Cape have called on government to give each unemployed graduate a monthly stipend of R3000 to assist with job seeking. Hundreds of unemployed graduates marched to the Premier&#8217;s Office to demand jobs. The march was a continuation of the series of flash mobs staged by the #HireAGraduate movement last week. The members handed over a memorandum of demands to the premier Phumulo Masualle.
