A Mooiplaas man whose family home was burnt down by angry residents in December over allegations he was selling drugs, but acquitted by the courts of the allegations, was brutally murdered while he was a sleep on Tuesday night. At the time of the attack Siphiwo Klentyi, 34, was in hiding at a Cambridge informal settlement with his uncle after Nyarha villagers chased him and three other family members out of his home in December. Klentyi was killed right on the feet of his traumati s ed uncle Phumzile Dlezi, 52. According to Dlezi, Klentyi screamed and pleaded in v a in with the attackers to spare his life. Dlezi said the attackers smashed down a door to Klentyi s shack with big rocks after he had refused to open. They yelled his nickname Spitch and he responded by yelling jar and they ordered him to open the door. He replied : I can t open for people I don t know at night . According to Dlezi four assailants fired three shots which wounded Klentyi before killing him with big knives. After shooting at him he fled his room and ran into my shack but they followed him and killed him on my feet. The horrific scenes played out at Cambridge Location s Mankayi Street at 10pm on Tuesday night. According to Dlezi, the suspects kept yelling you will all go in a row during the attack. I am very scared &#8212; I don&#8217;t know what to do. I am also fearing that they will come back for me. The family has been refused to view the body because it was so bad, said Nandipha Klentyi, the victim s siste r . Nandipha said her brother was stoned, shot and bludgeoned with golf clubs. This is very connected to the eviction from Mooiplaas. Eastern Cape police confirmed yesterday they were investigating a case of murder.
