Liquor regulations will come under the spotlight at a summit hosted by the Eastern Cape Liquor Board (ECLB) in partnership with the department of economic development, tourism and environmental affairs. ECLB chairwoman professor Lindelwa Majova-Songca yesterday said the liquor board had a mandate to regulate and strike a balance in the industry. One of our mandates is to allow entry into the industry. We also have to master the balancing act in terms of increasing the contribution to the economy and job creation as well as being aware of the social ills associated with the abuse of alcohol in our province, she said.Last month the Saturday Dispatch reported that Eastern Cape households had consumed R8-billion worth of liquor in 2013.Majova-Songca said while the R8-billion was not alarming when one considered the size of the province, Majova-Songca said it had to be considered that the Eastern Cape was one of the poorest provinces so where do people get the money to buy the alcohol?The summit will be held at the East London ICC from Sunday until Tuesday where traders, policy makers, the council of churches, municipalities, the police, manufacturers and the house of traditional leaders in attendance.It is not open to members of the public.Majova-Songca however said there were some community members who had been invited.Also expected to attend are Minister of Trade and Industry Dr Rob Davies, Department of Small Business Minister Lindiwe Zulu and Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi.Majova-Songca said: Control and monitoring of the liquor industry is by its nature an inter-governmental exercise. Some of the issues that will be discussed at the summit will include black economic empowerment compliance of liquor licence holders, monitoring of mushrooming liquor outlets, job creation of the liquor industry and impact of alcohol abuse.The Eastern Cape liquor industry contributes approximately R3.1-billion to the provincial economy, which accounts for about 1.24% of the total provincial production or value addition.The liquor board receives an average of 70 liquor licence applications per month.Majova-Songca said the board relied on municipalities to enforce bylaws when people wanted to trade in areas not zoned accordingly. We would like to encourage people to drink responsibly and not drink to get drunk which often has negative results, she said. siyab@dispatch.co.za
