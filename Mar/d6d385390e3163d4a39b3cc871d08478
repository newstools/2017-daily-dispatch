They were 12 teams when the Eastern Cape Super 12 club rugby tournament started in January but with seven weeks of action behind them, there are only two left standing after the men were separated from the boys. And now East London Police and Gardens lock horns for the provincial title at the Uitenhage Central Fields today (kick-off 3.30pm).It will be a battle between speed versus strength best of Border versus best of EP Rugby and favourites versus underdogs.Fans are in for a treat, as the teams play contrasting styles of rugby with the police men playing a more confrontational, in-your-face type of rugby, while the hosts like to spread the ball wide and use the width of the pitch.The competition was not without its challenges, as the semi-finals had to be postponed twice because of disputes over which teams were eligible to play in the last four.When they were eventually played last weekend, the cops edged Spring Rose in New Brighton, while Gardens broke Progress hearts at the death to book a place in the final.For the full story get a copy of the Dispatch or subscribe to our e-Edition for the complete newspaper with jobs, classifieds, crosswords, TV schedules and back editions.
