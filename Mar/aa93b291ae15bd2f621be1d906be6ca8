Tiny see-saws made from bits of bark, meandering minuscule streams of twinkling blue gravel and ice-cream stick miniature gates make up the enchanting world of a Beacon Bay fairy garden. Philanthropist and pharmacy co-owner Di Grassi, whose Pinewood Road home has become known as the Christmas house thanks to her Christmas light displays, has tapped into a global trend of miniature fairy gardening and transformed a corner of her manicured garden into a tiny wonderland.Grassi, who loves to turn her decorative hobbies into opportunities for donating food and toiletries to old age homes, has banded together with two fellow fairy gardeners for East London s first Miniature Fairy Garden Show on Saturday April 1. The fairy garden enthusiasts, who all live in Beacon Bay, will throw open their teeny gardens to the public, and enthusiasts can marvel at the beguiling worlds they have created.When she started stocking miniature fairy garden elements at her Vincent Park Family Pharmacy, Grassi caught the bug and her garden is filled with little enchanted forest scenes. Although Grassi buys many of her fairy accessories like tiny birdbaths, benches and woodland houses, she also uses her imagination and crafting skills to create pretty details and found objects like driftwood and shells. I also use plants like bonsai trees, succulents, moss and peace in the home, she said.Joining Grassi in the open fairy garden show will be Lynda Gower and her solar-lit fairy paradise and Charnay Russel, who has created a gnome garden in a tyre.Grassi s Christmas home is on the market because she and her pharmacist husband Ettiene are downscaling and moving to Sunrise-on-Sea, but she hopes the Miniature Fairy Garden Shows will grow and become an annual event. I love entertaining kids and in turn helping the elderly and I like to go over the top. The Miniature Fairy Garden Show will be open to the public from 11am to 3pm on April 1.Entrance is free, but donation boxes will be on site.There will be a tea garden selling tea and toadstool cupcakes for R10.A fairy gardening workshop for children will also be available for R50 per head, which includes lucky draw prizes.Follow the toadstool, flower and butterfly trails on the day to find your way.Proceeds go towards Easter treats for the residents of Langham House, Silvercrown and DJ Sobey.For more information, see Grassi s Facebook page, Fun and Fundraising for the Elderly. barbarah@dispatch.co.za
