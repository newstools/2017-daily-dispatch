While president Jacob Zuma was giving a keynote address at the Human Rights Day national celebrations in King William s Town, residents were protesting against lack of service delivery. Scores of residents in Bhisho Park, about 5km from Victoria Grounds where Zuma was talking about human rights, blockaded the R63 road with burning tyres and stones saying their human right to electricity was being violated after weeks of no power.One of the residents, Malibongwe Ngcukana, told the Dispatch their calls for Buffalo City Metro mayor Xola Pakati to address them after more than two weeks without power had fallen on deaf ears. As such we decided that today being Human Rights Day, which ironically is hosted in our metro, let us not attend and rather take to the streets to protest because we have not had electricity for weeks now and no one has given us an explanation, said Ngcukana.Ncedo Kumbaca, an ANC proportional representation councillor and the mayoral committee member heading infrastructure, posted on his Facebook page: I am here at Bhisho Park and our team has been working day and night since Tuesday last week. Today we are on the verge of a major breakthrough in this intervention and I can say without fear of contradiction that by 6pm [Tuesday] electricity will be back. Zuma said South Africa now enjoys a stable constitutional democracy where everyone is entitled to equal human rights. For the first time yesterday Zuma spoke out against the killings of taxi operators and commuters in the prolonged taxi wars engulfing Mthatha and Lusikisiki and the Border region since last year.This was just five days after the state and police decided to shut down the R61 route between Mthatha and Lusikisiki for a period of six weeks starting on March 16.The president promised that relevant government departments and the security cluster were attending to the matter, which has so far claimed more than 20 lives. The constitution says we have a right to security; we are thus very concerned [as government] about the high levels of crime in some communities, said Zuma. I have also been alerted to the problem of high crime rates in areas such as Lusikisiki and Mthatha where taxi violence has tragically claimed lives. Police and relevant departments are attending to these incidents. Zuma also hinted that his anticrime roadshow may be heading towards the area soon to listen to community members.He said South Africans needed to accept first that crime in the country was a problem and then work hard to root it out.Close to 50 people have been arrested in connection with the assassinations of taxi owners, drivers and innocent bystanders.The president also announced that the government was planning to provide free funeral benefits to the elderly.Zuma praised the government s social security programme, which in the main distributes social grants to more than 17 million people.He said the welfare programme was a huge achievement in fighting poverty .Zuma s speech in the main touched on issues of land poverty, radical economic transformation, racism and crime.This year s celebrations were linked with what has been termed the year of O R Tambo and the 40th anniversary of the death of Black Consciousness leader Steve Biko, who was born in Ginsberg in King William s Town.Zuma, premier Phumulo Masualle, Steve Biko s wife Ntsiki and others laid wreaths at the Steve Biko Garden of Remembrance.
