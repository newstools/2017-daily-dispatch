Two hundred thousand mandrax tablets with an estimated value of R16-million were seized in the Eastern Cape over the weekend. &#8220;This is the biggest drug bust in the province this year,&#8221; provincial police spokeswoman Brigadier Marinda Mills said this afternoon. The officer said drugs were fitted underneath a white Colt bakkie with a Gauteng registration plate. It was stopped by members of the Cradock Highway Patrol on Saturday just after 11.30pm. The vehicle was being driven by a 45-year-old man. &#8220;Police noticed that the vehicle had a long wheel base, but the canopy was smaller compared to the long wheel base of the bakkie. A decision was made that proper investigation be conducted at the police station where there was adequate lighting. Upon searching the vehicle, police discovered 200 000 mandrax tablets with an estimated street value of R16 million in a hidden compartment of the canopy,&#8221; said Mills. She said suspect was arrested and his vehicle was confiscated. Moments earlier the same members had pulled off a white Toyota Hilux bakkie with two occupants and discovered 23 bags of dagga an estimated street value of R1.4-million. The two suspects aged 25 and 27 were arrested. &#8220;Their vehicle with registration number FJ 99 JH GP was hired from Unitrans in Boksburg, Gauteng and was also confiscated,&#8221; Mills said. Mills said police suspect the two vehicles were bound for Port Elizabeth. It is still unclear whether the vehicles were traveling together. Mills said the suspects are appearing in the Cradock Magistrate Court today.
