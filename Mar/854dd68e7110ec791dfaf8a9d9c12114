The case against a dangerous fugitive who escaped from police custody in the East London Magistrate&#8217;s Court last October by pretending to be an attorney has been postponed to March 23 for a formal bail application. The accused Mlondolozi Mpayipheli, appeared in the East London Magistrate&#8217;s Court this morning but his matter was not heard at the request of his lawyer who needed more time to prepare for his defence. He was arrested last month by the Hawks, three months after he walked calmly out of the holding cells of the East London Magistrate&#8217;s Court dressed in a smart suit. Details of the escape and his re-arrest were not discussed in court this morning.
