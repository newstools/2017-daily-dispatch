I am out of prison but not yet free because the president has betrayed us on the question of free education. The struggle continues. Our demand is clear: we want free decolonised education he said outside the prison.He also proclaimed his innocence saying he had done nothing wrong from the beginning. I ve never done anything. I ve never assaulted a police officer. I ve never burned an institution. I never burnt those tyres I am alleged to have burnt he said.Khanyile was set to head to the Durban University of Technology campus where he was arrested. Students had already gathered to welcome him.
