A vibrant route teeming with art and craft pop-up galleries peppered along the scenic Wild Coast Jikeleza coastal route will again see visitors to the annual Art and Craft Weekend follow an art treasure map on Saturday and Sunday. Hosted by the Wild Coast Jikeleza Association s artists, the weekend will feature 10 pop-up galleries set up at the tourist route s lodges and restaurants.Four artist studios will also throw open their doors so visitors can see where the magic happens.Between art viewing, visitors can take a break and enjoy tea or lunch at participating restaurants.Organiser Jim Tannock, who started the art and craft weekend last year, said it was such a success that the pop-up galleries had doubled this year and would exhibit about 400 works at venues like Inkwenkwezi Private Game Reserve, Buccaneers Backpackers and Emerald Vale Brewery. Chintsa East wildlife artist Jennefer Ann Gordon Grant will be in attendance at her studio, as will multi-media artist Kate Teasdale, Jeff Rankin of Sunrise-on-Sea and Corrie Cowley of Kwelera, said Tannock, a watercolour painter who lives in Queensberry Bay.This year, art created by talented schoolchildren from Lilyfontein, Merrifield and African Angels will be on display at Umnenga Lodge on the Glen Eden Road.To participate in the art and craft day, the first port of call must be at the information desk at Crossways Centre on Schafli Road, where a free route map and discount vouchers can be collected.This also serves as the entry form for lucky draw prizes, which can be entered on condition all galleries are visited.Gordon Grant said visitors were welcome to pop in at her studio to view her realistic oil paintings and watch her at work. They can also bring their favourite photograph and commission me to paint it, Gordon Grant said.Penny de Lacy Smith, also of Chintsa East, who will be exhibiting oils and pen-and-inks of South African lighthouses at Inkwenkwezi, said: We have really good artists in this area, so it is good exposure for them, plus it also puts the Jikeleza Route on the map. Sunrise-on-Sea artist Jeff Rankin, who is well known for his woodcuts, said visitors would be able to see an etching class in progress at his Albatross Studio.Sal Price, co-owner of Buccaneers Lodge and Backpackers, said their 1.6km access road had been beautifully upgraded and a spread of paintings were on display.Tea, coffee and treats will be sold to support Acacia Tree nursery school.Tickets costing R100 for wine tasting at the Murambi Rose Caf with sommelier Charles Poole on Saturday at 5pm will be available at the Crossroads information centre.At 6pm, also at Murambi, visitors can mingle with artists at a free cocktail party. barbarah@dispatch.co.za
