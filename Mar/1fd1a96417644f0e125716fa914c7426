Lawyers representing #FeesMustFall activist Bonginkosi Khanyile will pay his bail at 8am on Thursday paving the way for him to finally be freed after months behind bars. Khanyile won his Constitutional Court case on Wednesday and was granted bail of R250.He spent more than 150 days in custody after being arrested during often violent protests at the Durban University of Technology in September 2016.The Economic Freedom Fighters including party leader Julius Malema who submitted an affidavit to the Constitutional Court in support of Khanyile said he had been incarcerated for so long because authorities had decided to make an example of him.Dunstan Farrell of Farrell and Associates told TMG Digital one of their attorneys would be at the Westville Prison in Durban to make the payment.He would have been freed on Wednesday afternoon had it not been for administrative issues. [The] prison required the original court order [and] would not let him out on a copy said Farrell.
