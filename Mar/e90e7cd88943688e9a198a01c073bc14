HELEN SPARROW!!!!&mdash; PEARL THUSI (@PearlThusi) March 16, 2017This woman&#8230; wow. And conveniently calls it colonialism. Did we ask for pipes??? Did we they have to die for transport &amp; f&#39;ing pipes?!? https://t.co/OuUAVE8nlK&mdash; PEARL THUSI (@PearlThusi) March 16, 2017When Pearl saw that Zille was getting on board a flight in the midst of the storm it just infuriated her more.She also coined a new name for her making reference to Penny Sparrow who caused a stir in SA in 2016 over racism comments labelling her Helen Sparrow .Because African heritage was savage and imptoper- yet our land is good enough.
