We are really devastated by the loss of Joe Mafela. Joe was a loving person. A person who you will never find angry at any given time. He was always jolly. I was always with him. We used to travel together. Even going to our homeland in Venda he would never travel alone without me.Paul asked God for guidance to lead the family. I pray for strength and to guide us further now that our leader is no longer here.
