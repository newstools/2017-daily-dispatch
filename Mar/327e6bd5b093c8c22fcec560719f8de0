Border Bulldogs ran in seven tries to edge the South Western District Eagles 54-36 at a highly entertaining friendly encounter at the Buffalo City Stadium on Friday night. It were the visitors that drew first blood with a converted driving maul try in the 3rd minute. But the Bulldogs immediately hit back with successive tries from wingers Sibusiso Ncanywa and Michael Makasa. Both teams attacked relentlessly but it were the visitors that had a slim 29-28 lead after 40 minutes. Bulldogs backs continued where they left off in the second half and continued to exploit the Eagles defense. The Bulldogs got into gear in the second stanza and ran away with the game against Eagles who relied on line outs and driving mauls to score tries. Oliver Zono, Lunga Dumezweni and Saneliso Ngoma also crossed the tryline for Border while Zono also was also tasked with the kicking duties.
