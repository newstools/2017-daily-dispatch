The combined average for all the dams is 47.92%. We have not set out definitive consequences for these people [who waste water] but we will be having an internal meeting tomorrow to discuss exactly that Trollip said. The measures may vary from knocking on people s doors issuing fines naming and shaming [to] controlled water supply or [cutting] off the entire water supply. But at this stage we have not laid out exactly how we will address the situation. Trollip tweeted after his visit: A visit to the Churchill dam that is at 27% capacity has been a most sobering experience!
