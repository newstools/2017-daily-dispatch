Suspected Gumtree conman Kenton Nark was denied bail by the East London Magistrate s Court yesterday. The 29-year-old is facing one count of fraud valued at R186000 and another of escaping from the Cambridge police station.He is also wanted by police in Port Elizabeth on a charge of fraud and another of escaping from the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court on March 3.The court heard that Nark had 17 other cases pending against him.He was arrested inside the Cambridge police station on Saturday.Nark told the court that he lived in Roodepoort, Johannesburg, and came to East London earlier this month to accompany a friend who was here to see relatives.He said he then decided to look for a car as he was told East London had the best vehicle deals in the country.He is accused of defrauding two East London residents of a vehicle worth R160000 and a laptop worth R26000. The items were advertised for sale on Gumtree.Nark allegedly got in contact with the owners posing as a buyer.The state claims Nark later sent fraudulent text messages claiming he had paid for the items.The vehicle, a BMW 135i, has since been recovered but the laptop is still missing.Moments before bail was denied yesterday Nark s Legal Aid attorney, Mtimkhulu Mphahlwa, argued for his release.Mphahlwa said he could not understand why his client was charged with a Schedule 1 offence if the state was adamant Nark had a previous conviction, was out on bail and had 17 pending cases. Your worship, the state s case is weak and my client should be granted bail as he will not intimidate witnesses or interfere with the investigation, Mphahlwa said.Presiding magistrate Nazeem Joemath said that the defence s argument about the Schedule 1 offence was 100% valid. The prosecutor [advocate Wayne Jafta] was not prepared to present this case. [Investigating officer] Captain Antonio Estraus s testimony was also not of great assistance, beside creating confusion on aspects he was not quite aware of. The state needed to be prepared to state why they are opposing bail. On the other hand the applicant has a right to have his bail application heard as soon as possible, Joemath said.Joemath said there was satisfactory evidence that Nark s release on bail would jeopardise the functioning of the criminal justice system and as result he should remain in custody until the finalisation of his matter.The case was postponed to April 28. zwangam@dispatch.co.za
