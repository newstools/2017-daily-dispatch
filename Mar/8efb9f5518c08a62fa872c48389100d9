A University of Fort Hare student was rushed to hospital as police raided the institution&#8217;s Elwandle residence this evening. At this moment it is not yet clear what injuries the student sustained or whether her hospitalization had anything to do with the raid.When the Dispatch team arrived at the residence just after 10pm, the student was seen carried by a paramedic to an ambulance that was parked next to the residence. More than 60 students, including SRC secretary of the &#8230; East London campus, Dineo Selemela were arrested and taken to Fleet Street Police Station. Most of those arrested were inside the residence. Earlier, the students blockaded part of Fleet Street between Cambridge and Currie streets with fire. The students have been boycotting classes since last week Tuesday, demanding the university address their grievances.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
