Eastern Cape transport MEC Weziwe Tikana yesterday reiterated calls for patience on the roads, saying it was unacceptable that human lives were lost through road accidents every day. The burden also impacts heavily on our health system and social welfare where more and more people rely on our social security net for survival. Tikana was addressing more than 300 people at a mass memorial service at Mangathi village in Dutywa for eight victims of a crash that took place on the notorious N2 near Dutywa last week.Among those killed were five women, one of whom gave birth to a premature baby in May this year.They were killed after a bakkie in which they were travelling from town to their villages in Mangathi overturned.The eight victims have been identified as Linda Tafeni, 22, Bukelwa Loki Mbuka, 68, Sikelele Mahamba, 28, Agnes Jako, 87, Xolelwa Mbeki, 36, Bongiswa Mchithwa, 34, Kwanele Nyombo, 22, and Malibenye Yamani, 67.Six other passengers were admitted to hospital after sustaining injuries.Tikana, who was joined by Mbashe municipality mayor Samkelo Janda, lamented the fact that some of those who died had left children whose wellbeing would now be in the hands of their husbands. Reckless driving is still one of the major contributing factors to accidents reported in South Africa, she said.For the full story get a copy of the Dispatch or subscribe to our e-Edition for the complete newspaper with jobs, classifieds, crosswords, TV schedules and back editions.
