After four years of complaints about noise from Rhythm Bar in East London, residents say it has become even louder. The local watering hole in Amalinda Main Road has been causing havoc and sleepless nights for neighbours.Despite attempts to straighten out the problem, residents say owner Jason Ionnides has turned them away.Last year, residents pulled together and reported the grievances to Buffalo City Metro, which conducted a site visit in November and found that Rhythm Bar did not comply with the Business Zone 1 development regulations.BCM found fault with structures that did not comply with the approved business plans, there was insufficient onsite parking and the establishment was not approved for a place of entertainment.BCM gave Ionnides 30 days to comply, and handed their findings over to the metro s legal department.BCM spokesman Samkelo Ngwenya could not say when they handed Ionnides over, but said it was after all processes had been exhausted. It is to be noted that despite numerous meetings and undertakings from the owner, no application for council s special consent to operate a place of entertainment has been received, hence the reason why we have involved the council s legislative arm, he said. With regards to the noise and other disturbances, our law-enforcement unit responds to all complaints and is dealing with them in the same manner we handle all such establishments, Ngwenya said.The Dispatch earlier reported that Rhythm Bar patrons were causing havoc in residential roads.For the full story get a copy of the Dispatch or subscribe to our e-Edition for the complete newspaper with jobs, classifieds, crosswords, TV schedules and back editions.
