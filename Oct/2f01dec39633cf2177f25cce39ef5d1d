Mdantsane’s little Imbo Fufu’s face lights up with sheer excitement as he hears sound for the first time after his cochlear implant was switched on.  In September, it was the first time that Frere Hospital performed a cochlear implant because they had previously been sending patients to the Western Cape. This time, a private sector doctor did the operation closer to home. A  cochlear implant is an electronic device that replaces the function of the damaged inner ear. Unlike hearing-aids, which make sounds louder,  cochlear  implants do the work of damaged parts of the inner ear (cochlea) to provide sound signals to the brain. Part of the device sits on the outside of the ear. Imbo, 2,  was first diagnosed with a hearing impairment in both ears when he was nine months old.  Now two years old, Imbo can be seen in the video responding to hearing sound for the first time. Which of the five human senses is the most important? Is it that of sight, hearing, taste, smell or touch? Most will argue that they are all important and it is impossible to choose. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdPN5nPHYHY For Belgravia family Colin and Rowena Williams helping their baby make sense of a world… January 20, 2017 In "Daily Life" His parents had to clap to get baby Lincoln Martin’s attention before they realised he had a hearing problem.
