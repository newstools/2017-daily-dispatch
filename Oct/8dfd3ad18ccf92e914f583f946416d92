By ZINGISA MVUMVU and SIMTHANDILE FORD A major showdown is looming in the Eastern Cape after the ANC provincial leadership threw its weight behind Cyril Ramaphosa while Amathole region announced Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as their preferred candidate.
Both decisions were communicated this afternoon. The provincial executive committee (PEC) decision to back Ramaphosa was made by provincial chairman Oscar Mabuyane after the the newly elected PEC held its first meeting at Dan’s Country Lodge near Mthatha at the weekend.
Said Mabuyane: “This was a special resolution from the conference where the branches instructed us as the PEC to lobby for the election of Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to become the president of the ANC.
“The election of the current deputy into [the] presidency proved logic[al] to us and will create consistency and stability which will in turn provide investor confidence on the ANC led government”. Meanwhile the Amathole region took a special resolution to back Dlamini-Zuma at its regional executive committee (REC) meeting held today
Amathole regional secretary Teris Ntutu said Dlamini-Zuma’s discipline and commitment to service delivery and her humility underpinned the ANC’s values.
“It is for this reason that the REC took a resolution to support comrade Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to be the next president of the African National Congress,” said Ntutu.
The clash between the Mabuyane PEC and Ntutu’s region was to be expected as they stood on opposite sides during the chaotic Eastern Cape provincial conference where Mabuyane defeated Phumulo Masualle two weeks ago. Ntutu supported Masualle.
The developments in the Eastern Cape came as the ANC’s national working committee (NWC) was expected to receive a report, today, on the provincial conference where a fight broke out between Masualle and Mabuyane supporters. – This is a developing story and more details will be in the print edition tomorrow​
