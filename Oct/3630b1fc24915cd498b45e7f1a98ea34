Panic over an alleged storm about to break over East London has been dismissed by the SA Weather Office. “There is no reason at all to panic. No warnings have been issued for the East London area. In fact, the weather is clearing until Thursday when a cold front will appear along with slight rain,” said Garth Sampson, spokesman for the Port Elizabeth weather office. He was commenting minutes after a member of an East London suburban WhatsApp group claimed at 1.34pm “Just received info from the airport that the next storm is to hit us in 45 minutes. Have been warned to stay indoors.” Sun bathed most of East London 30 minutes later and the only sign of rain were light fluffy clounds. Over Beacon Bay bright blue skies appeared.
