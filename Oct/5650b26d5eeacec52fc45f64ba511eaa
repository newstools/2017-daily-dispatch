President Jacob Zuma has called on teachers to honour the legacy of iconic former ANC president Oliver Tambo by putting a stop to violence in schools.  Speaking at Tambo’s centenary celebrations in his birth village of Nkantolo in Mbizana he said Tambo had wanted to see children from poor backgrounds like Nkantolo receiving good education in science and other critical subjects. Tambo, who is recognised as the ANC’s longest serving president, was at some stage a maths and science teacher. “There should be no violence in schools, there should be no abuse of pupils by teachers and also abuse of pupils by other pupils must not happen,” he said. Zuma was given a rousing welcome when he touched down in rural Nkantolo where he first flicked on the electricity lights in 81-year-old Iris Nomthetho Mnyameni in Ludeke village.The elderly women recently received an RDP house from government after having stayed in a mud house for years. After that he went straight to Nkantolo where he addressed thousands of people who had gathered for the main event.
