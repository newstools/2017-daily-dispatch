The Amathole region in the Eastern Cape has endorsed Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to become the next president of the party. This resolution was taken during the region’s ordinary Regional Executive Committee (REC) meeting held today, said regional secretary Teris Ntutu in a statement. This comes on the day the Oscar Mabuyane-led provincial executive committee officially endorsed another presidential hopeful, deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa.
But Amathole is singing a different tune saying Dlamini-Zuma is the suitable candidate to move the the ANC forward. “The discipline, unwavering commitment to service, humility and love for our people that comrade Nkosazana has truly represents the values of our movement. Her decisiveness and unifying character makes her the exact leader that the ANC needs at the present moment,” said Ntutu. “It is for this reason that the REC took a resolution to support comrade Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to be the next president of the African National Congress.”
