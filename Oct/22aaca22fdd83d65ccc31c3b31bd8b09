The number of reported residential burglary cases in most police stations in the Eastern Cape has drastically increased during 2016-17 compared with previous financial years. This was revealed by Police Minister Fikile Mbalula when he released the crime statistics on Tuesday. Mbalula’s report revealed cases of home burglaries reported in Buffalo City Metro (BCM) and the Mthatha area has escalated, with the Cambridge police station in East London recording the biggest increase. According to the report, the station – which covers the suburbs of Cambridge, Vincent, Amalinda, Selborne, Bunkers Hill, Stirling, Bonnie Doon, Nahoon, Dorchester Heights, Berea, Dawn, Summerpride and Chiselhurst – had 300 more home burglary cases reported between April last year and March this year. This represents an increase from 671 in the 2015-16 financial year to 971 in 2016-17. Previous crime stat reports show that the station has consistently sent in high numbers of home burglaries. Police told the Daily Dispatch that this was because of the vastness of their jurisdiction, coupled with the fact that it consists largely of the type of suburban homes that criminals target most often. In the past 10 years, according to the report, close to 10000 home burglary cases were reported at the station – an average of 1000 a year. On a brighter note, its reported murder cases decreased by two from 16 in 2015-16 to 14 in 2016-17. However, other violent crimes at Cambridge showed an increase. The number of rape cases increased from 59 to 62, while other sexual offence complaints increased from 78 to 83. Robberies in the residential area increased from 23 to 40 and drug-related crimes from 111 to 162. At Mdantsane police station, the biggest in the township, the number of burglaries also shot up. In the financial year that ended in March, the station recorded 466 reports, an increase of 134 from the 332 in 2015-16. This is while residential robberies increased from 30 to 40. However, other violent crimes at the station decreased: murder from 37 to 30; rape from 102 to 89; other sexual offences from 125 to 113 and drug-related crimes from 242 to 227. In Duncan Village at least one half of the pattern was similar: residential burglaries increased from 367 to 402 a year later. However, cases of rape, sexual offences and drug-related crimes had also increased. Mthatha’s Madeira police station showed a similar rise in residential burglaries: the number rose from 83 to 145. Recorded murders rose from 37 to 49. R ape cases increased from 41 to 51 and other sexual offences from 46 to 54. Drug-related crimes rose from 210 to 263. Stock theft shot up from one to eight reported cases in the period. In King William’s Town, there were 77 more reported residential burglaries in the year under review (up from 433 to 510), an increase of rape cases from 43 to 45, other sexual offences up from 62 to 71, and drug-related crimes from 84 to 94. On a happier note reported murders in King William’s Town dropped from 15 to 12 and car hijackings from 11 to 7, while residential robberies decreased from 37 to 21 and stock theft from eight cases to six. However, at Peddie police station, murders increased from 10 to 14 and drug-related crimes from 33 to 35. Stock theft cases more than doubled – from 32 to 66. — asandan@dispatch.co.za Burglaries in East London’s suburban homes are the highest in the province, and that is official.
