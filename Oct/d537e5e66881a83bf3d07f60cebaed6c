The Department of International Relations and Cooperation said on Monday it could not immediately confirm whether any South Africans were wounded or killed in a shooting at a music concert in Las Vegas at the weekend.  “It’s too early to tell‚” said spokesman Nelson Kgwete. The department would be able to confirm later in the afternoon on Monday. At least 20 people were gunned down and more than a 100 others wounded when a gunman opened fire at the concert in the gambling capital on Sunday. Reuters reported the alleged gunman had since been killed. Las Vegas Metro Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo was quoted as saying that his death came after police “engaged the suspect”. The motive for the attack was not immediately clear.   Source: TMG Digital.
