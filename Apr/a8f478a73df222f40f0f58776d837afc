Award winning Willowvale-born singer Bethusile Mcinga will tonight appear on our small screens not to sing but to present a music show. The Zundithwale hit-maker will co-host a music programme called Amacilongo with friend and stablemate, Mdumiseni Nzimande popularly known as Dumi Mkokstad at 9pm tonight.Mcinga, son of Lusanda Spiritual Group founder, Lusanda Mcinga said he was very happy with the direction his life was taking. I am very happy, but I am nervous at the same time. I just wish the views will receive the show well, he said.Mcinga said he and Nzimande were at Dumisa TV studios sometime last year when they saw an advertisement that the channel was looking for presenters for their new show. We approached one of the managers immediately, but were told that we were not good enough for what they were looking for. They told me that I am very shy, while they told Dumi that he was a bit forward, he said.He said when they returned to the Eastern Cape after the shoot, they recorded themselves presenting, then sent the demo to the channel. To our surprise they told us that they liked our combination and we would sign a contract to host the show , he said.Mcinga said they started shooting in March. In the show we invite church choirs and discuss whatever topic we have for that particular episode. He admitted that at face value people think he is shy, but when I am on stage singing, I become a different performer .Mcinga started his music career as one on the backers of his mother s gospel outfit.In 2008 he released his debut album titled Mandibe ngowakho.His latest album, Zundithwale became a hit among gospel lovers winning the soft-spoken singer multiple awards, including song of the year during the 2014-15 SABC Crown Gospel Awards.He said the show would introduce him to a totally different market. And people will see a side of me they do not know, he said. sinom@dispatch.co.za
