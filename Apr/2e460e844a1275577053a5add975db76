Golf&#8217;s dynamic duo of Siviwe, 28, and Yolanda Duma, 26, have both had an amazing year since they turned pro late last year. The sisters, who were born and raised in Mdantsane NU7, come from a golfing household and started playing at a tender age while tagging after dad, Enoch Duma, on the green. I come from a home where everyone plays golf except my mother. My brother, who lives in New York, plays professional golf, so I guess it s in our DNA, Yolanda said.Siyabulela Siya Duma was awarded a scholarship to play professional golf in Florida, Miami, and now lives in the US.The sisters made their professional golf debut in this year s Sunshine Ladies Tour, in which they got their order of merit and made it to the top 50. This was our first time playing professional golf and we played under great pressure because we did not have financial backing, which was stressful, older sister Siviwe said.The Sunshine Tour is a step away from the Investec Cup, which could be the launch pad to playing internationally.The top 10 in the Sunshine Tour get to compete in the Investec Cup, and the five best performers in this tournament receive European cards the ultimate goal for these sisters. But for now we just want to focus on gaining more experience and being the best golfers we can be, Yolanda added.While there may be pressure that comes with the game and being a first-time pro golfer, Siviwe said she has gained strength to continue playing the sport she loves. Playing pro is very different from when you re still an amateur, as now we re playing for money and it s got a whole lot of different pressures. Since this was our first year playing the sport professionally, from next year the aim is to win and be better golfers. Siviwe s only concern and focus for next year is to make a name for herself and make IGT membership, which will allow her to play national and international tournaments.The sisters wished all amateur golfers well and encouraged them to continue playing.Some amateur names to look out for are Zethu Myeki and Demi Flanagan, they said. namhlam@dispatch.co.za
