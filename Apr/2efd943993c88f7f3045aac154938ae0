There was a deep, systemic failure in Eastern Cape education, said lobby group, Equal Education, which yesterday launched its report revealing appalling conditions at some provincial schools. The launch was held at the Steve Biko Centre in Ginsberg.The EE s 100-page report, titled Planning to Fail, highlights the plight of 60 schools across seven districts in the province, where 17 schools were found to be operating in outright violation of the law when it comes to norms and standards for school infrastructure. Thirteen schools were either made of inappropriate materials such as mud, with zinc or wood, five schools had no working toilets and only 15% of schools had flush toilets.The norms and standards are a legally binding commitment made by the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to fix all schools.In terms of the norms and standards, by November 29 last year, all schools had to have access to some form of sanitation, as well as power and water supply.Schools entirely made of inappropriate materials such as mud, metal, asbestos or wood had to be replaced with new school structures. EE agents visited the 60 schools in November last year to investigate government s compliance with the norms and standards regulation.Just before the deadline date, the DBE confirmed it would fail to meet the first deadline stipulated.The report states DBE Minister Angie Motsekga s claims of substantial progress being made to meet the norms and standards were untrue.Yesterday, the launch started with a visit to two of the schools listed in the report, Vukile Tshwete High in Keiskammahoek, and iQonce High in King William s Town.The school heads at both dilapidated schools, said little had been done since EE visited them last year.Government officials were invited to the launch, including MEC for education Mandla Makupula, but failed to attend.EE provincial head, Luzuko Sidimba said they were forging ahead with their court case to fix loopholes so that the minister would carry full responsibility for fixing schools.The launch continues today with more school visits in the Butterworth area.It ends tomorrow with a march to the education head offices in Zwelitsha.
