Black Monday has left many South Africans seeing red. They took to Twitter to voice their concerns about the call to wear black in reaction to the growing concern over President Jacob Zuma s recent Cabinet reshuffling. The reshuffle saw Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas being sacked. Malusi Gigaba has taken the reigns at National Treasury with Sfiso Buthelezi at his side.Many were disappointed that other national issues had not prompted a #BlackMonday response.Dijtjhaba Selemela tweeted: I always wear black in the form of my skin and my issues have always got the least attention.
