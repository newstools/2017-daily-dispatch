Sheba, the 13-month-old lion cub who escaped from her enclosure at Mpongo Private Game Reserve on Wednesday night, has died. Police spokesman Captain Mluleki Mbi said the young lioness died from stress endured during the three-day search and rescue mission. Mbi said the lioness died on Friday, shortly after she was recaptured by the game rangers, anti poaching unit and a vet. They spotted her and darted her with a tranquilliser and brought her back to her enclosure, but due to the trauma she had suffered she succumbed. That is according to the game reserve, Mbi said.The private game reserve has later announced on their Facebook page that the young lioness died due to dehydration, anaemia and stress associated with her escape. Sheba was recaptured inside the 3200ha game reserve.The four-star establishment remained tightlipped yesterday. General manager Martin Jansen van Rensburg refused to comment and referred the Dispatch to their Cape Town-based PR agency, Eclipse. However, spokeswoman Kirsten Smith, who promised to release a statement, had not done so at the time of writing.The 60kg Sheba escaped from her 2.7m-high enclosure and double 11000-volt electric fence at the reserve near the N6 outside East London on Wednesday night. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
