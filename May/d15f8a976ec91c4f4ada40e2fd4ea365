State refutes an accident expert s claim that the man accused of causing the death of Top Billing presenter Simba Mhere was travelling at only 80km an hour. The defence s witness accident reconstruction expert Stanley Bezeduinhout had told the Randburg Magistrate s Court that Preshalin Naidoo s car was travelling no faster than 80km/ph when it collided with Mhere s vehicle.Naidoo faces charges of culpable of homicide and reckless and negligent driving. He has pleaded not guilty.On Friday prosecutor Dinesh Nandkissor said it was impossible that Naidoo s car was travelling at that speed. You want this court to believe that the car hit a curb and collided with the deceased s travelling at 80 kilometres per hour despite the tracker report? Nandnkissor asked. Those are my findings. It is not my thinking but it s the information available to me that yielded the results countered Bezuidenhout.Mhere and his friend Kady-Shay O Bryan died in the crash on William Nicol Drive in Fourways Johannesburg on January 31 2015. The trial continues.
