A Dale College pupil died in hospital after being shot, allegedly by a man he had tried to rob at an ATM. Headmaster for the King William s Town-based school, Mike Eddy, yesterday confirmed that a senior pupil at the school had died after he was shot.According to police, the incident happened on Sunday evening in Downing Street in the town s city centre.KWT police spokeswoman Captain Siphokazi Mawisa said the 17-year-old, who has not been named, is alleged to have followed a man from an ATM to his car, which was parked a few metres away.He is alleged to have pulled a knife on the victim and stabbed him.However, the man retaliated. During the robbery, the victim was stabbed and he shot the [17-year-old] suspect. Both the victim and the suspect were taken to hospital for treatment. The pupil died at Grey Hospital a few days after he was admitted, and the victim has since been discharged, said Mawisa.She said police were investigating a case of murder and robbery.Eddy said the circumstances surrounding the pupil s death were still vague. We have not spoken to his family yet, so we do not have all the information, he said.Eddy said the deceased completed Grade 8 at the school and left for Queen s College in Queenstown, then returned to Dale at the beginning of this year. He comes from a good family and his father is very supportive, said Eddy. I know this will reflect badly on the school, however we cannot control what happens outside school hours. arethal@dispatch.co.za
