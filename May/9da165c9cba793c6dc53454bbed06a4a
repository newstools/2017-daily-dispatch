There was an outpouring of grief on Tuesday after news that several people had died after a possible terror attack at a pop concert in Manchester in England. Police said 19 people had died in the incident outside the Manchester Arena after a performance by singer Ariana Grande.&nbsp;Fifty people were injured.Loved ones began frantically looking for those who had gone missing after the attack.Some residents however were defiant.Journalist Lauren Duca tweeted an email she had received from a Manchester resident which read: We in this city have not reacted to this attack with vitriol; or with fear. We have not even reacted in open defiance (yet). Our first reaction has been to take to the streets with water with supplies to open our homes to those who are stranded and also sadly to guide the families who have lost their children through to the centre of a city they don t know.
