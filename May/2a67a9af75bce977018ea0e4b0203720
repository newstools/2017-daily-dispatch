The ANC must &#8220;elect the right leaders&#8221; in December if it hopes to win the 2019 general elections with an overwhelming majority. This is according to the party&#8217;s deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa who was addressing party members at the Joza Multipurpose Centre in Grahamstown today during a Cadres Forum that drew a crowd of more tha 2000 ANC supporters.So optimistic is Ramaphosa that he believes that his embattled party can surprise many and get more than two thirds majority come 2019.&#8220;If we take the right steps, make good promises and elect the right leaders we will be able to get an overwhelming majority,&#8221; said Ramaphosa.&#8220;In my view we can get 75% as long as we do the right things and take the right decisions. It is not beyond us.&#8220;Now let us get ready for our conference to elect leaders who will move us forward not backwards; leaders with vision; leaders with content, leaders who can be trusted and leaders with intergrity.&#8221;Should the party go this route in its conference, said Ramaphosa, the oppostion parties&#8217; hopes of a coalition government in 2019 would be nothing but a pipedream.
