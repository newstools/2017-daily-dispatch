ANC presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma believes &#8220;Radical Economic Transformation&#8221; should sweep through the entire African continent. This , she said , during her keynote address at the SA Funeral Practitioners Association (Safpa) g ala d inner on Monday night at the East London ICC. Dlamini-Zuma attempted to explain what the popular phrase in the mouths of ANC politicians is , according to her touching on various sectors from minerals, ocean economy, land and energy , saying as Africa embarks on a journey to economic transformation &#8220;South Africa must be a locomotive as one of the continent&#8217;s big economies &#8220; . Exports v Imports Dlamini-Zuma believes Africa should reconsider exporting its raw resources that it cannot afford when they come back as imports of finished products. &#8220;The problem with this is that when you export raw materials you are exporting jobs,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Instead of jobs being created here in Africa it means they are created in the countries to which we are exp o rting to.&#8221; Land According to her, Africa at the moment is not using land productively and the continuous selling of land to foreign investors is unsustainable. The continent also needed to start processing the food it produces instead of exporting it to Europe and America for that to be done. Said Dlamini-Zuma: &#8220;Africa is the only continent that imports 87% of processed food that it consumes. How can we , because processing food is no rocket science we can do it ourselves this has to change.&#8221; She adde d that 60% of the world&#8217;s arable land was in Africa &#8220;but we must be careful because foreign people are coming to buy land. before we know it we will not have enough land for the growing population of our continent&#8221; . Mineral resources For the former African Union Commission chair, it was puzzling that Africa despite all its mineral resources continued to have high levels of poverty. &#8220;That paradox must change we cannot have a rich Africa with poor people,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Developed countries elsewhere used what is ours to be what they are.&#8221; Financial illicit flows Dlamini-Zuma said Africa was losing &#8220;billions&#8221; every year via illicit financial flows because it lacked skills while foreign companies were doing as they please. She blamed trade agreements African states had with foreign companies saying they favoured the latter at the expense of the former. &#8220;We must understand (foreign) comp a nies are not here for charity. In isiZulu sithi ifa leyilima lidliwa ziyihlakaniphi (the wise benefit from the sweat of fools) therefore we need to be clever. &#8220; Industrialisation For Africa to achieve real growth and prosper on its own, it had no choice but to industrialise on a massive scale, said Dlamini-Zuma. Ocean economy It is in this industry that Africa is being short-changed as everything is foreign &#8211; owned and controlled, she said. To this end, the continent must &#8220;reclaim our seas&#8221;. Said Dlamini-Zuma: &#8220;We do not have ocean vessels of our own that take exports and imports even though 90% of exports and imports of our s are transported through the sea but we do not ow n those vessels. &#8220;The people who work in the vessels are not ours, the consumables are not ours, insurance of cargo not ours , therefore we must reclaim this whole area of economic activity.&#8221; Energy infrastructure She said: &#8220;Can you believe it the whole African continent is generatin g energy that is the same amount as just one European country &#8211; Spain.&#8221; This was changing but no t fast enough, she went on : &#8220;We cannot do things we want to do without enough energy we must change this.&#8221; Peace For &#8220;radical economic transformation&#8221; in Africa to be achieved, peace on the continent was imperative. &#8220;Decision is that we must work hard to silence the guns in Africa by 2020. This does not mean there will be no conflict but it must be dealt with th r ough dialogue not the b a rrel of a gun,&#8221; she said. Women But for all the above to be achieved, women and the youth must be at the centre, said Dlamini-Zuma. &#8220;Africa has a big population of a billion -plus and young and therefore drivers of this programme towards prosperity must not exclude women and youth,&#8221; she said.
