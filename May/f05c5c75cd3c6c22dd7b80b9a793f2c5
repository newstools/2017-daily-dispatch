Magistrate Magaola Foso found that Pieter Doorewaard 26 and Phillip Schutte 34 who are accused of murdering local teen Motlhomola Mosweu have satisfied the court that they will stand trial.The men say Mosweu accidentally fell off the back of a bakkie while they were taking him to the police station for stealing a sunflower from a field.The incident has fuelled racial tensions in the North West town. If kept in custody the accused will lose their employment because the investigation is still not complete and continued incarceration will cause irreparable harm [to them] Foso said.They are to reside at alternative addresses they provided the court.
