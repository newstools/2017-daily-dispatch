Another taxi owner Themba Mrubata, 48, has been gunned down in what is suspected to be related to ongoing taxi violence in the OR Tambo municipal region. Provincial police spokesman Captain Khaya Thonjeni said Mthatha police were looking for two unknown suspects who stabbed, shot and killed the Uncedo Service Taxi Association (Usta) official at the Uncedo offices in Eagle Street, Mthatha, on Friday. It is alleged that [Mrub was in the office together with other office staff, when two unknown men entered the office and went straight to Mrubata and first attacked him with a knife. The one suspect also produced a firearm and fired several shots at Mrubata, said Thonjeni.This shooting comes just weeks after the Eastern Cape leader of the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco), Noluntu Mahashe, was hospitalised after being shot in her home in East London.Speaking to the Daily Dispatch yesterday, Thonjeni said the two assailants fled the scene. Five 9mm cartridges were collected from the scene.Although a case of murder has been opened, police did not want to speculate on the reasons for the attack. No arrests have been made, he said.The taxi feud between (Usta) and Border Alliance Taxi Association (Bata) caused the provincial Transport MEC Weziwe Tikana to intervene and propose a peace agreement.Usta national president Ntsikelelo Gaehler said they were still saddened and shocked by the death of yet another member. We really thought things were well on the way to being resolved and ending the violence, said Gaehler.
