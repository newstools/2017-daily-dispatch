Provinces supporting President Jacob Zuma known as the premier league suffered their first defeat at the ANC policy conference when they failed to prevent secretary-general Gwede Mantashe from presenting a scathing organisational report. The documents paint a grim picture of the state of the ANC stating that the party s leaders have failed to provide leadership to the country which has been interpreted as a direct attack on Zuma.In an attempt show its strength at the first day of the policy indaba under way at the Nasrec Expo centre in the south of Johannesburg a delegate from Mpumalanga raised an objection to Mantashe s tabling of the diagnostic report arguing it was not the tradition of such gatherings to discuss documents of this nature.The delegate was supported by others from like-minded provinces such as North-West and the Free State.But Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza later rose to ask that the objection be withdrawn upon realising they did not have enough support as other provinces such as Gauteng the Eastern Cape and Limpopo took them on.Meanwhile Minister of Trade and Industry Rob Davies has warned South Africa could face widening levels of inequality as a result of the emergence of digitalisation and technological advances as a result of the 4th Industrial Revolution.Speaking at the Progressive Business Forum s breakfast ahead of the second day of the ANC National Policy Conference Davies said the country needed a radical change in its approach to economic changes.In order to prepare for the changes he said there needed to be a radical change in the approach to how manufacturing and other industries function with a focus on aligning with international standards which have moved towards more complex value chains. We will have to use trade policy tools informed by the need of industrial development he said.&#8211; Sunday Times&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
