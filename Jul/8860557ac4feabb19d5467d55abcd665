Unseemly posters advertising penis enlargements and backyard abortions have become an eyesore on Buffalo City Metro buildings and property owners have had enough. Daily the posters are glued on walls overnight costing property owners thousands of rands as they have to remove them or paint over the papers, which are often pasted using a high strength adhesive that is difficult to remove.Ben Staden, who owns buildings on Buffalo and Argyle streets in the city centre said his battle against the posters started 15 years ago and each year it intensifies. I have recently asked for a quote from a paint company to once again refurbish the building, and this time I even asked the painters for a paint that is [resistant] to anything sticking on it. I was surprised when the painter told me that I was the 10th building owner calling for quotes because of the posters damaging the walls in the city centre. Staden said he was told there was no paint yet on the market that would resist things sticking to it. The municipality is doing nothing about this and it is not only tainting our building, but also the municipality s. They need to be more proactive and have by-laws in place, he said.Hawker Lulama Ntlanganiso who has been operating in front of the King Pie in Oxford Street for 17 years now, said she had made it her duty to clean up the posters on the wall behind her. Tourists come here and take pictures of the posters which advertise penis enlargements, abortions and other terrible things, and they think it s me. According to BCM s by-laws it is illegal to affix unauthorised advertisements without the metro s approval on to these properties.BCM spokesman Samkelo Ngwenya had not responded to the Dispatch at the time of writing. mbalit@dispatch.co.za
