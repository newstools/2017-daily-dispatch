Somizi Mhlongo has recounted how he was once hauled in by the taxman for owing a whopping R3.4 million. The Idols judge made the revelation in his memoir Dominoes:Unbreakable Spirit.In an excerpt from the book Somizi said he cried &#8220;bucketloads&#8221; when confronted in 2009 about the debt he owed .&#8220;And then the taxman hit me. He told me I owed R3.4 million. I went SARS offices and they nailed me. I sobbed in front of them. I was crying bucketloads &#8221; the excerpt read.Somizi explained the taxman wanted to take a car which he borrowed from a friend to service some of the debt.&#8220;They were going to take my car. I told them the car wasn&#8217;t mine. They forced me to sell my house. I tried to stall that and find ways of getting out of the mess without shedding my house. It was tough &#8221; Somizi added.The incident took place at a time when Somizi said he was heavily indebted depressed and cried every day.&#8220;It was difficult to the point that I cried every day. At night I felt better that the day was over and I hoped for a better day tomorrow. But when I woke up and realised that I was still in that I&#8217;d cry all over again. I started ostracising myself &#8221; he revealed.Somizi&#8217;s Dominoes: Unbreakable Spirit was released last week at a swanky launch party in Johannesburg. It is available at Exclusive Books nationwide.Source: TMG Digital.
