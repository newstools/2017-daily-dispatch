Four villagers have appeared in the Flagstaff Magistrate s Court today on charges of murder. They were arrested by police on Wednesday in Ntlenzi village in connection with the murder of two local youths who were stoned to death last year after they were accused of terrorising and killing villagers and targeting pensioners who were attacked at their homes, especially on pension days. One of the villagers who declined to give out his name for fear of reprisals, told the Daily Dispatch that the two victims had been hunted by the community and had confessed to the crimes. He claimed they were then taken to a field by a village mob where they were allegedly stoned to death. Following the arrest of four villagers on Wednesday, angry residents of Ntlenzi blockaded the R61 between Flagstaff and Magusheni. The villager claimed this was after they had gone to the police demanding to be also arrested and charged along with the four suspects. Police spokesman Captain Mduduzi Godlwana confirmed this morning that the four had been charged with murder. They are still in court as we speak, said Godlwana.
