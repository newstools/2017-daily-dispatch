More than 2 000 schools in the Eastern Cape only had two or three teachers, the MEC for education Mandla Makupula admitted this week. Speaking at the education sector lekgotla in Johannesburg, Makupula said 219 schools in the province were led by just a single teacher, making the learning environment difficult. We cannot hope to have quality education when there are schools run by a single teacher. In fact by the end of 2016 we had 219 one-teacher schools and that s a crisis and you expect that children must get quality education from that situation, said Makupula.The Dispatch last year visited a primary school that had only two teachers and recently the paper visited two schools in Mdantsane which were earmarked to be closed.For the full story get a copy of the Dispatch or subscribe to our e-Edition for the complete newspaper with jobs, classifieds, crosswords, TV schedules and back editions
