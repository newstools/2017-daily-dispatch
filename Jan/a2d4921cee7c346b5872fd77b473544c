The registration of newcomers at the Walter Sisulu University s (WSU) Ibika campus in Butterworth due to start today has been delayed after staff went on strike due to the water crisis. WSU Ibika campus is a victim of the water crisis that is affecting the entire Mnquma Municipality since early last year. All water taps at Mnquma have run dry while dam levels hit an all time low.The students representative council (SRC) has since warned university management to engage them about possible solution.Should this not happen, campus SRC president Zubenathi Sopazi warned that a protracted protest action was looming.Sopazi says it is unacceptable that the crisis has lasted for a year. We had an expectation that government will intervene. Amathole District Municipality came in to assist but 40000 litres of water a day fall far short to meet the demands of 7000 people in this campus, said Sopazi. Our interest is not to strike but to come with possible amicable solutions but due to the arrogance of management we may well end up going for a mass action. The registration delay may continue beyond today.
