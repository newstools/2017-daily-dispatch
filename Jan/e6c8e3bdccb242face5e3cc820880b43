Tensions in the ANC s DR WB Rubusana region spilled over to the Buffalo City Metro (BCM) council, where the ruling party s caucus displayed deep divisions yesterday. The split between supporters of mayor Xola Pakati and suspended regional secretary Phumlani Mkolo was evident when the council meeting held to discuss the replacement of acting city manager Nceba Ncunyana and a vote of no confidence motion against Pakati was abruptly adjourned without the two items being discussed.The heated meeting was called off by council speaker Alfred Mtsi after an appeal by the ANC and council chief whip Mzwandile Vaaibom, who refused to provide council with reasons for the adjournment.Addressing council after a short caucus with his comrades, Vaaibom pleaded with Mtsi to adjourn the meeting, saying there were legal aspects that would affect council if they went ahead with the meeting.This was two hours after the meeting had sat discussing the auditor-general s report on BCM and other items.Vaaibom said he could not provide council with reasons for his request for an adjournment but promised to do so in the next council meeting to be scheduled within the next seven days . There are legal aspects that I cannot dwell much on at this moment that prevent us from continuing with the meeting. I can only provide reasons for this in the form of a report which we will table in the next council meeting, was all Vaaibom could say.As a result, ANC councillors believed to be supporting different party factions were soon arguing with each other over the validity of the adjournment without reason.The ANC s Crosby Kolela, deputy mayor Zoliswa Matana and Sindiswa Gomba ran out of breath trying to prevent the adjournment of the meeting without valid reasons given .Kolela said it was against the rules to adjourn a council without giving valid reasons for doing so, while Gomba said she had no problem with the postponement but was worried about wasteful expenditure associated with such an impromptu adjournment. Just give us something we can cover ourselves with for this wasteful expenditure, Gomba unsuccessfully pleaded with Vaaibom and Mtsi.The decision to adjourn without reasons given was supported by some ANC councillors, including Pakati and mayoral committee members Ncedo Kumbaca and Helen Neale-May, among others.Speaking to the Dispatch after the council meeting, Mtsi said: The proposal was brought in by the chief whip, who said proceeding with the meeting will be in conflict with some legislation. They do have reasons as to why they asked for such, but they reserved them for a proper report on the matter, a report which will be tabled during a formal council meeting within the next seven days. Numerous ANC councillors and regional executive committee members, who spoke to the Dispatch on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the removal of Ncunyana as acting municipal manager was to be discussed confidentially.Sources said the Pakati- aligned faction of the ANC caucus had planned to replace Ncunyana with the metro s head of executive support, Ncumisa Sidukwana, while those aligned to Mkolo were said to have been against the decision.It is also alleged that the Mkolo faction wanted to push for a vote of no confidence against Pakati.Sources said it was the glaring division within the ANC caucus over these two issues that led to the sudden adjournment of yesterday s council meeting.The drama unfolded in front of a packed gallery which at times erupted into pro-Mkolo revolutionary songs, while others were heard hurling insults at Pakati.In clear anticipation of possible conflict, the main door to the East London City Hall was locked and those in attendance had to use a back entrance to access the meeting venue.This was while a large contingent of law enforcement officers was stationed inside and outside the venue.The Dispatch further understands that the pro-Pakati faction immediately went for their own caucus minutes after the aborted meeting yesterday.Neither Pakati nor acting regional secretary Gura Maleki could be reached for comment at the time of writing yesterday.The Dispatch reported that cracks within ANC structures in the region were laid bare last week when the party s two camps nearly came to blows at a meeting in Mdantsane. asandan@dispatch.co.za
