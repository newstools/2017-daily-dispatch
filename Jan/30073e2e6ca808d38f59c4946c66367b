Parliament s portfolio committee on communications meets on Tuesday to discuss the process of appointing an interim board of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) a government statement said. The meeting comes after Parliament s ad hoc committee on the SABC board inquiry last week deliberated over a working document to complete a draft report on its probe into the crises at the public broadcaster.Among the recommendations of that report was that the dissolution of the SABC board be expedited and finalised urgently .The last remaining member of the board chairperson Prof Mbulaheni Maghuve resigned last year.The Congress of the People s Dennis Bloem said on Monday that there is no other way of rescuing the SABC other than appointing an apolitical board that will serve all the people of this country and not a political party . The committee members must put the best interest of the country first and not the interest of their respective political parties he added.
