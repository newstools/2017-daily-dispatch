How much richer we are having heard her sing. How much she touched our spirits and made us complete beings in a world in which things were falling apart. How her voice endured to sing with us in the age of democracy, during which she was honoured with the order of Ikamanga in Silver in 2006. uMama Thandi Klassen was feisty, street smart, &amp; full of life. She stood the test of time, having had a career which lasted over 5 decades. We ll remember her song Sophiatown where she masterfully &amp; beautifully describes the town where she was brought up.
