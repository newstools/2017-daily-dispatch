SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago has denied that the broadcaster is taking action against Umhlobo Wenene radio presenter Nomonde Vakalisa after the gospel host was accused of soliciting bribes for interviews on her radio show. According to Move gospel artist Yonghama Mrwetyana claimed that Nomonde had demanded R2 000 to interview him on her popular gospel radio show. I approached the station for an interview because Umhlobo Wenene is a national radio station with a large audience which I wanted to reach. She (Nomonde) told me to pay R2 000 which I paid because I was promoting my album Yonghama told the magazine.Nomonde rubbished the claims but the SABC still opened an investigation into the matter.Giving an update on the investigation SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago told TshisaLIVE on Friday that the case was now closed because the investigation could not find evidence of bribery. There was no evidence to suggest that the presenter had solicited or accepted a bribe and we could not take any action if there was no evidence of wrong doing Kaizer said.The investigation comes six months after the SABC fired former Ukhozi FM DJ Chilli M for accepting certain enticements in exchange for playlisting music.Kaizer explained that the broadcaster took all claims of bribery and corruption seriously and would take the harshest possible action against any employee found to be guilty. We have had to deal with bribery at the broadcaster before and we have had not problem with dismissing and taking legal action against those found guilty. In those cases we did an investigation and found proof of bribery and acted swiftly Kaizer added.Kaizer denied that bribery was a problem at the SABC and said that it was an issue faced by broadcasters around the world. The problem is a global one. It is that people are willing to offer money to radio presenters and programmers for exposure and these presenters and programmers are willing to accept the bribe Kaizer added.
