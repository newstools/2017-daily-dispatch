The new school year got off to an incident-free start yesterday at two of Mdantsane s top performing schools. Ulwazi Secondary School gained fame in 2014 for its 100% pass rate when President Jacob Zuma delivered a cow as reward.The NU2 school was the only township school counted among the top performers in the Eastern Cape at the time.Last year the pass rate dropped slightly to 95.2%.Science and maths teacher and head of department Mihlali Edmond Makhalima said the school had fielded 83 matric candidates, 10 of whom were progressed pupils (having a second go at the exams).Makhalima said only two progressed pupils had not passed while the rest had achieved diploma qualifications.Makhalima said although there had been a decline in the pass rate, the school had used the same methods as previous years.The school usually hosts two matric camps to help pupils revise for exams, and last year it held three camps.He said parent involvement and dedicated staff had also contributed to good results. Pupils in Grade 10 and 11 have to attend morning and afternoon classes. We have a very strong code of conduct which is well monitored. Makhalima said the school faced issues of overcrowding every year, a lack of classroom facilities, and a shortage in teachers and resources.Another school from the township that performed well last year was Khulani Commercial High School, which achieved an 81.1% pass rate.The school fielded 166 matric pupils in 2016, 133 of whom passed.Top performer Yamkela Mlandulwa finished with seven distinctions.School Principal Vuyisile Badiyana said more than anything the school focused on quality. We are looking forward to the day we achieve a 100% pass rate and we believe it is possible, he said. qaqambam@dispatch.co.za
