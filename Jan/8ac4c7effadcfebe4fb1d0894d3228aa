Charges against Tyityaba nature reserve manager Karl Krull and his co-accused, Siza Masentile, have been withdrawn. The announcement was made by prosecutor Wesley Peter-George a short while ago in the Komga Magistrate s Court where the two accused were appearing. Addressing presiding magistrate Michell Pillay, the prosecutor said: The Director of Public Prosecutions in Grahamstown after much consultation has declined to prosecute based on the available evidence. The State is withdrawing the case against the accused. The two were facing charges of attempted murder, pointing of firearm, assault and crimen injuria. The case related to an incident last August where Krull and Masentile caught Lwando Folokwe and Akhona Dyantyi inside the nature reserve with a dead bushbuck. They claimed Krull shot dead their two dogs, pointed his gun at them and ordered them to eat one dead dog, which they say they did. Court was adjourned. Outside court Krull declined to comment.
