Strap your zinc roof down, bring your laundry inside and put your car under cover, because severe thunderstorms are expected later this afternoon. The storms will extend from the escarpment to the coast.SA Weather spokesman in Nelson Mandela Bay, Garth Sampson, said: The weather over the Eastern Cape today still looks favourable for thunderstorm development over most of the Eastern Cape in the late afternoon including the coastline. Severe thunderstorms are possible in places but it is difficult to pinpoint an area so far in advance. The public are advised to look for updates on radio, TV or on the SAWS website (www.weathersa.co.za) regarding potential severe thunderstorms. Forecaster Tennielle Ah Shene said: The weather system causing these thunderstorms is a deep surface trough over the interior with an upper air trough to the west of the country. This combination of systems produces unstable conditions and with available moisture in the air, thunderstorms will be triggered. The province is still reeling from storm gusts which on Monday killed tavern patron Dumane Bebe, 63, and injured 80 others, including 23 children.Homes were flattened and people injured when a roof zinc and other sharp debris scythed through the air and walls collapsed. mikel@dispatch.co.za
