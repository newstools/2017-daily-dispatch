Two former King Sabata Dalindyebo (KSD) municipal employees jailed five years ago after being found guilty of involvement in a plot to murder five senior ANC leaders have been released from prison. Thembinkosi Mapeyi and Thembile Ceba had their convictions and 18 year jail sentences set aside on appeal.The duo spent their first night at home on Tuesday after a Mthatha High Court full bench of appeal found that the trial judge had erred by not conducting a trial-within-atrial.This was after the men s lawyer, Pumza Malefane, had objected to the admissibility of recording evidence said to be taken by an undercover agent.On July 19 2013, Mthatha High Court acting Judge Mandisa Kahla sentenced the pair to 18 years behind bars, three years of which were suspended for five years on condition they were not convicted of a similar crime.Ceba was also sentenced to two years for unlawful possession of a firearm. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.Mapeyi, who was a driver for the KSD mayor for several weeks in 2002, and Ceba had been in prison since their arrests by the Hawks in March 2011 after what was believed to be a hit list was exposed by the police.They were found guilty of plotting to assassinate rural development and agrarian reform and ANC provincial spokesman Mlibo Qoboshiyane, ANC provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane, ANC KSD sub-region chairman and now also KSD mayor Dumani Zozo, O R Tambo regional secretary Lulama Ngcukayithobi and Solly Nduku, a former O R Tambo district municipality mayoral committee member.At the time of the arrests, Mapeyi was a driver and Ceba a bodyguard to former KSD mayor Siyakholwa Mlamli now an O R Tambo district mayoral committee member.The appeal court judges all agreed that Kahla had erred by not complying with section 25(a) of the Criminal Procedures Act by failing to hold a trial-within-a-trial. Generally when the admissibility of evidence is in dispute that issue should be dealt with in a trial-within-trial. The appellants right to a fair trial were indeed infringed and the evidence tendered cannot in the circumstances of this case be admitted under the limitation of the rights clause either. It is indeed in the interest of justice to set aside the proceedings, the judges found.The court ruled that the matter would need to start afresh and be heard by another judge.National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Luxolo Tyali said they would need to study the judgment before deciding on a way forward. lulamilef@dispatch.co.za
