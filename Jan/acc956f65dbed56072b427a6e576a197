Parkside Primary School might re-open next Monday if the department of education delivers on its promise to have the school fixed by then. Yesterday, disgruntled parents barricaded the school gates, preventing department officials and service providers from leaving the premises without giving them answers.The school was trashed during the holidays by thieves, who burgled the property four times.On a visit to the school last Wednesday, a Daily Dispatch team noticed that electricity cables had been ripped from walls, leaving wires exposed. Water pipes were stolen and toilets broken.The thieves took a computer, as well as roof sheeting from above the corridors, and taps were ripped from their mountings.The first day at big school turned into heartbreak for those among the 1200 pupils enrolling for the first time at school, when they were sent home last Wednesday.Pupils accompanied by their parents yesterday returned to the school to hear the outcome of a meeting scheduled between the school governing body (SGB), the principal and officials from the department.SGB chairman Thanduxolo Faku said the meeting yielded some promising outcomes. The service providers were at the school to assess the damage and the department has promised to have construction workers on site by tomorrow to restore the water and electricity supply. We can only reopen the school after water and electricity has been restored, as the exposed electricity wires were hazardous to both staff and pupils. The broken toilets, and having no water, poses a health risk, said Faku.Last year, the school experienced another spate of break-ins that forced pupils to stay at home for weeks. Last year, the damage caused by thieves was estimated at more than R250000. We are yet to determine the cost of the latest damage, said Faku.The school, which is constructed out of prefab material, was built 50 years ago.Parents said they would have appreciated the forethought of an interim solution for their children instead of them simply rocking up on the first day of school this year only to be told to go home.Parent Janha du Plessis said she was worried about children roaming the streets when they were supposed to be in school. The department should at least make arrangements with nearby schools, community halls and churches to accommodate the pupils so that they can at least be taught, said Du Plessis.Julia Mei said her Grade 1 six-year-old daughter was heartbroken and begged her every day to take her to school.A spokesman for the department of education, Malibongwe Mtima, confirmed that repairs to the school would start tomorrow. arethal@dispatch.co.za
