Acting Thembu king Prince Azenathi Dalindyebo used his first public appearance in 2017 to attend a Friday night vigil with the Zenzile family, who are mourning four members who were shot dead on New Year s Eve. He also visited storm-ravaged villages around Mthatha.The four Zenziles were buried after a mass funeral at KuNqwathi near Mthatha on Saturday.Nomaphantsi Zenzile, 66, her pregnant daughter, Ntombikayise, 37, and her two granddaughters, Zintle, 18, and Sinesipho, 14, were shot dead on December 31 when a gunman came knocking.Nomaphantsi s son Msizeleni, 40, opened the door and, after initially pretending to be lost, the gunman opened fire, grazing Msizeleni s left shoulder. He fled and the killer killed the four women.In his message of condolence, Dalindyebo urged police to work with haste to arrest the killer before he attacked again.Addressing the bereaved family members on Friday, he urged them not to seek revenge.Dalindyebo showed his spiritual side and Christian convictions, referring the mourning families to biblical verses and speaking of the amazing work of God in times of trial and bereavement.Among the mourners were ANC provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane, King Sabata Dalindyebo executive mayor and ANC sub- regional chairman Dumani Zozo, and OR Tambo district mayor Nomakhosazana Meth.The two municipalities and Plaatjie s Phakamani Bantu funeral parlour worked together to assist in giving the family members a decent send-off.The funeral parlour donated a coffin and provided vehicles while the municipalities provided tents, a sound system and groceries.Dalindyebo also visited the January 2 storm-smashed areas and was overwhelmed by the extent of damage, especially at Payne Farm villages, where Dumane Bebe, 63, was crushed under a tavern wall and schools and churches were damaged.The storm damage is estimated at R215-million.The prince said he was not personally able to help with money, but would encourage the government to assist the storm victims. lulamf@dispatch.co.za
