Luvuyo Mfaku NPA spokesperson told TimesLIVE that Nel handed his resignation to his boss Advocate Sibongile Mzinyathi the director of public prosecutions in Pretoria.Nel he said has cited other interests outside the NPA. The NPA wishes Nel well in his future endevours. We have other highly capable prosecutors who will take over his current cases. In the cases that Nel is working on he has a team of prosecutors who will help to carry on with these cases as they have intrinsic knowledge of these cases. South Africans have responded with shock to the news.Ayanda Mpofu @AyandaMpofu2 tweeted Gerrie Nel 24 hour resignation notice so sudden&#8230;there s something fishy about Nel s resignation what or who is he running from? while Botlalo @dionbotlalo shared This move does not come as a surprise.
