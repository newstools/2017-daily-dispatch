South Africans concerned about their HIV status will no longer have to go to healthcare centres for testing. They will now be able to learn their status from the comfort of their own homes thanks to a decision by the South African Pharmacy Council (SAPC) to allow pharmacies to resume selling HIV-test kits.Amos Masango, registrar and spokesman of the council, said pharmacies had been prohibited from selling the kits, but they were easily available everywhere else. These kits were sold everywhere else by unqualified people. This prompted the council to review the decision. At least it will be sold by qualified health personnel who can augment the already-stretched resources in government facilities. Pharmacy owners around East London had mixed reactions to the news.John Ford, owner of John Forbes pharmacy in Oxford Street, said he welcomed it, although with reservations. It was done previously, and my pharmacy will sell these kits, but I am more in favour of a controlled environment where the patient can receive counselling before and after testing. Shane Pagel of Devro-kem pharmacy in Gonubie was less welcoming. HIV testing is best left for doctors and nurses. What if the test comes back positive who will comfort the person facing the dilemma? It s good to make it accessible, but I feel the negative implications are too great. I won t sell the kits in my pharmacy. According to Dr Lydia Darby from the Sophumelela Centre, the decision may get more South Africans to check their status. The negativity attached to HIV in our communities is what makes people shy away from getting tested. Maybe this way more people will get tested, she said.Darby blamed the secrecy with which the disease was treated as the main reason for its stigma and prevalence. Testing for HIV should be viewed in the same light as testing for pregnancy or diabetes. The result doesn t end your life, it just alters it. nonsindisoq@dispatch.co.za
