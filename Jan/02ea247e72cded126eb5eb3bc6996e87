One of the AbaThembu feuding royal factions has lambasted cooperative governance and traditional affairs MEC Fikile Xasa accusing him of thinking he was the nation&#8217;s king. They call ed on him to refrain from directly involving himself in the day-to-day administrative affairs of the kingdom. The outcry came after Xasa call ed for an AbaThembu general meeting at Bumbane Great Place near Mthatha at 10am tomorrow in an effort to bring an end to the nation&#8217;s royal succession row. But a royal family faction , aligned to jailed King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo&#8217;s brother Prince Mankunku Mthandeni Dalindyebo , claimed the MEC had no right to call for an AbaThembu general meeting and accused him of thinking he was the king himself. Xasa on January 27, wrote letters to the leaders of the feuding royal family members inviting them to an AbaThembu general meeting. Fuelling further anger was the MEC s invitation letter did not attach an agenda of the meeting scheduled for 10am at the G reat P lace. &#8220;Xasa is not our king, he is not even a member of AmaDlomo clan and therefore does not have an authority to summon our traditional leaders and our people to a general meeting of the nation,&#8221; said angry Mankunku&#8217;s faction leader , Chief Zwelithobile Mtirara. He said it was an insult they were invited to a meeting without an agenda and Mtirara added that Bumbane was under litigation an d could not be used as a meeting place. Xasa s spokesman Mamnkeli Ngam defended the MEC saying he was not poking his nose into AbaThembu affairs but trying to assist them to find a lasting solution to their challenges. &#8220;We are begging everyone to attend the meeting for the sake of the nation ,&#8221; said Ngam.
