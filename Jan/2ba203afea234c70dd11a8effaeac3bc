Hundreds of Lilitha Nursing College graduates from across the Eastern Cape are today marching to the seat of power in the province to demand that they be hired immediately. Leaders of the group are locked in a meeting with officials from the provincial department of health in Bhisho. They say they are not leaving Bhisho without appointment letters which they claim to have been promised in November when they confronted the department twice. One of the protestors, Sabelo Matiwane from Cofimvaba , said he graduated in 2014 but w as never employed . &#8220; This is problematic because several hospitals across the province are understaffed,&#8221; said Matiwane. &#8220;Yet more and more nursing graduates from Lilitha Nursing College are joining the unemployments stats every year . &#8220;It makes the whole idea of the nursing college a joke if government is going to train people to sit at home while public health care in the province is not in the best of states&#8221; . The group submitted their memorandum of demands at the beginning of November and returned for a reply on November 15, where they claim to have been promised appointment letters.
