The financially drained Amathole district municipality (ADM), which failed to pay contractors last year, splurged R15-million on cellphone allowances, 3G cards and data for employees and councillors. The money was spent in the 2015-2016 financial year.The municipality s precarious financial position also did not deter the ADM council from paying R33.5-million in bonuses to more than 1800 staff members.Despite ADM s woeful performance, R2.1-million of the R33.5-million was spent on performance bonuses for eight senior administrators an average of R262500 each.The district council, which is teetering towards financial ruin and is currently struggling to provide drinking water to some drought-stricken local municipalities, also spent R27.1-million on travel allowances for staff and councillors.The information is buried in a confidential council report, seen by Saturday Dispatch, which was meant to be tabled by municipal manager Chris Magwangqana at a council meeting on August 23.ADM spokesman Siyabulela Makunga yesterday said even though the report formed part of the agenda, it was never tabled.Makunga told the Saturday Dispatch yesterday: It was subsequently found that the figures referred to in this report were incorrect as they were largely inflated. He said the report had been rewritten, incorporating the correct figures . Unfortunately, until council has had an opportunity to play its oversight role in integrating the corrected report, ADM is not in a position to divulge the corrected figures at this point, said Makunga.He said the rejigged report would be placed before council shortly .Makunga said the cellphone and travel allowances and bonuses formed part of the municipal employees and councillors remuneration package that has been in existence since the 1990s .He said the municipality was obligated to make the payments. The council resolved last year, as one of the belt-tightening measures, that non-essential travel outside the district will no longer be allowed. It must be emphasised that ADM is on a belt-tightening and cost-cutting drive, and funds have only been spent on obligatory and essential items, he said.He later retracted those comments, saying he had been told the municipality would no longer comment on the issues.The report also reveals that R2.2-million was blown on hotel accommodation, and the hiring of vehicles and sound systems in 2015-16.In his report, Magwangqana states that ADM paid more than R13.5-million for cellphone allowances to its staff and councillors during the past municipal financial year, while R2.1-million was paid for 3G card usage.The report reveals that R1.9-million was paid by the municipality to book hotels and hire vehicles, while close to R400000 was spent on hiring venues and sound systems for municipal events.ADM is the water-supplying authority for six local municipalities under its jurisdiction, including Amahlathi, Mbhashe, Mnquma, Great Kei, Ngqushwa and the newly merged Raymond Mhlaba municipalityHowever, due to severe drought, ADM has been struggling to provide adequate water supply in some of these areas.Intensifying drought has seen dams running dry, and ADM has enforced water restrictions in some of the local municipalities.This is the same district municipality that in the past financial year failed to pay some sub-contractors involved in the aborted R630-million Siyenza contract to build thousands of toilets in a number of villages.The Siyenza contract came to a halt with some of the toilets yet to be completed.Last month, the Dispatch reported that ADM s development agency, Aspire, was financially battling to survive and some critical posts could not filled for lack of budget.Aspire is also struggling to pay staff salaries due to its shrinking budget, and some posts had to be downgraded.In February last year, the Dispatch also reported on ADM plans to sell off properties to pay staff salaries and bills. So dire was the financial squeeze at the time that former mayor, Nomasikizi Konza, tried to sell off non-core ADM assets.In a report to the ADM council she proposed the sale of 28 non-core items including land with a claimed value of R43-million.The list included a R6-million mayoral house and state-owned plot in East London valued at R1.9-million, as well as properties in Cathcart, Chintsa, East London, Haga Haga, Morgan Bay, Stutterheim, Sunrise-On-Sea and Winterstrand.But her fellow ANC councillors and opposition members disagreed with the plan. At the time, ex-council speaker Samkelo Janda confirmed the council had pressured Konza to scrap the plan and instead increase water and sanitation tariffs, saying ADM would need to find other ways to raise capital . asandan@dispatch.co.za&nbsp;
