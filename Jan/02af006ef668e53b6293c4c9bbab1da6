Zoleka Mandela is not shy about sharing personal moments about her life. When she was undergoing chemotherapy after being diagnosed with breast cancer Zoleka openly documented the horrid side-effects. While asking a women s weight is just not done Zoleka posted a picture of herself on a scale revealing that she weighs just under 80kgs. This is just what I don&#39;t need in my life! I deliberately didn&#39;t weigh myself on Friday because I can&#39;t deal with feeling discouraged especially when I&#39;m making so much progress with my weight loss &#8230; Who makes these bloody scales in the first place and why? I know what I have to do, forget the scale for a few weeks and focus on the more positive &#8230; Like how much lighter I feel, how loose my clothes are and I actually need to get my measuring tape out right about now! I really don&#39;t feel like working out anymore, this 79.9kgs has just made me SO tired and irritated!!! All the weight is probably just my FAT booty and FAT stomach put together!!! Arghhhhh!!!! #GettingBackTo70Kgs #WeightLossJourney #WorkOutMotivationA photo posted by Zoleka Mandela (@zolekamandela) on Dec 30, 2016 at 9:35pm PSTSince the end of last year she has spoken about wanting to get back to 70kgs and posted pictures of herself when she was in better shape. December 2015, I had long reached my goal weight of 70kgs in April of that year! Got the definition on my abs from doing the 30 day Ab Challenge but I don&#39;t think I want to do that again, it was hectic!!! Don&#39;t laugh, I had already gained about 2-3kgs here!!! Guys, I don&#39;t know how to maintain 70kgs, I reach my goal weight (always on my birthday) then I gain it all back again. I need serious help this time around &#8230; I don&#39;t know where to even start!!! #FoodAddict #GettingBackTo70Kgs #WeightLossJourney #WorkOutMotivationA photo posted by Zoleka Mandela (@zolekamandela) on Dec 29, 2016 at 8:04am PSTIn an effort to get motivated and rally her fans behind her Zoleka decided to share her journey and has posted pictures of her body. She has already come a long way and has lost around 7kgs. My FUPA (Fat Upper Pubic Area) is my problem area actually my whole stomach as you can see so I don t quite know where to place the tape she wrote next to a picture of herself doing her measurements. Okay! So today is Day 1 of the 30 Day Ab Challenge and my measuring tape is out, only &#8230; I&#39;m not too sure if I&#39;m measuring right? I&#39;ll have to Google it later. My FUPA (Fat Upper Pubic Area) is my problem area, actually my whole stomach as you can see so I don&#39;t quite know where to place the tape? This is what my measurement for today is, 92.5cms. Just about to hit the treadmill although it&#39;s my rest day and do my ab workout. See you on the flip side!!! #FupaMustFall #30DayAbChallenge #Day1 #GettingBackTo70Kgs #WeightLossJourney #WorkOutMotivationA photo posted by Zoleka Mandela (@zolekamandela) on Dec 31, 2016 at 11:53pm PST
