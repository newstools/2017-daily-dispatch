Pupils from Nobhotwe Junior Primary School in NU 6 Mdantsane were yesterday greeted with the sight of damaged classrooms following recent hailstorms. The temporary classrooms built in 2012 by the department of education suffered severe damage in the storm.The classrooms were flooded, windows broken and parts of the roof had caved in.Principal Mkhululi Mngxekeza said the shortage of classrooms at the already overcrowded school had affected them negatively.He said teachers were having to share classrooms in order to accommodate the large number of pupils. Grade 6 teachers had to share classrooms with Grade R teachers, which has resulted in a lot of chaos and disruption. But we managed to have a productive day despite these challenges. The primary school offers classes from Grade R to Grade 6 and has 928 pupils for the 2017 academic year. Grade 4 pupils are the ones most affected because they don t have classrooms. There are 218 Grade 4s this year, and they are all in the school hall. Each Grade 4 teacher has more pupils this year than last year. He commended the department of education for being helpful and involved in their plight by promising new temporary structures before the end of the week.Department of education spokesman Loyiso Pulumani said the department was working hard to assist schools affected by the hailstorms across the province. The department is delivering 288 classrooms to 105 schools in the province and the Office of the Premier is delivering 106 classrooms. He went on to say that plans were in place to build permanent classroom structures in schools like Nobhotwe in the next two-and-a-half years. nonsindisoq@dispatch.co.za
