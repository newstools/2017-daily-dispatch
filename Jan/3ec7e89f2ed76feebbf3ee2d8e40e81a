Traffic ground to a standstill this morning on the busy R72 at Kenton-on-Sea when service delivery protesters burned tyres and debris on the road. Police fought running battles with pockets of stone throwing protesters from nearby Ekupumleni township. A protester said they started demonstrating at 5am after residents became annoyed that work had stopped on much needed RDP housing. Public order police from as far as East London came to the resort town. Burning barricades were also erected on the R343 to Salem. Traffic is flowing again but the situation is tense.
