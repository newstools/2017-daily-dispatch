The ANC Youth League in the province has entered the thorny succession debate, laying bare their preferences in the national and provincial leadership contests. The league s provincial task team (PTT), which took over the reins late last year after the provincial executive was disbanded, met over the weekend and resolved to support current Eastern Cape ANC chairman Phumulo Masualle in his bid for another term.In a press briefing in King William s Town yesterday, the youth formation also revealed that they will have no problem with a female president taking over the ANC reins from Jacob Zuma when the party goes to its national elective conference in December.Even though the league did not name their preferred female candidate, they hinted at Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, whose name was first raised by the national ANC Women s League (ANCWL).During the briefing the PTT s provincial convener, Mziwonke Ndabeni, said the views of the province in the succession debate will be informed by the decision of the league s national executive . However, in principle, we do not have a problem with a woman president as articulated by the ANCWL, especially in addressing the issue of patriarchal society. At provincial level the PTT appreciates the relative stability both in the ANC and in government and therefore supports the current chairperson [Masualle] to be given another opportunity to lead the ANC when conference comes, Ndabeni said.The party s provincial elective conference is set for July.Ndabeni said the league appreciates the existing political debate informed by the fact that 2017 was a conference year. However, the PTT resolved that we should spend more time on policy discussions as we prepare for the national policy conference later in the year. We stand firm on the generational mix as a principle guiding the participation of young people in ANC structures, Ndabeni said.Meanwhile, the league s PTT also revealed that they had resolved to disband four of their provincial regions, while the task team of a fifth region would be replaced.The leaders of the affected regions Buffalo City Metro, Chris Hani, Alfred Nzo and Joe Gqabi staged a walkout when this was announced by the PTT s coordinator Ntombikayise Mnyengezana in their weekend meeting on Saturday.Ndabeni yesterday said they had decided to replenish the existing regional task team (RTT) of the Amathole district as it had passed its sell-by date as it was appointed in 2013. We will now develop a political programme focusing on cadre development in each region, as well as appoint new RTTs to take the organisational work forward. Ndabeni said that process should be concluded within a period of not more than two weeks .He said the PTT would resuscitate the debate on radical economic transformation. Our observation is that the Black Economic Empowerment policy is too broad, and as such it loses its intended objectives. asandan@dispatch.co.za
