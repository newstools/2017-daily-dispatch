The men are still at large. We urge anyone with information about the crime to contact the investigating officer Warrant Officer Sandile Tongo on 043-722-9718 or 082-301-7345, Mzuku said.The pupils taught by Marsh every day live with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, asperger s syndrome, dyslexia and down s syndrome.The Dispatch spoke to a parent whose child was turned away from school as a result of the crime. She lost everything and she is not insured. They took everything. The children were sent home because there were police investigators at the daycare centre, the parent said. [Marsh] has helped so many people in this town. If some parents do not have money for school fees she does not send the kids away. She allows them to pay whenever they can. The parent called on the community to rally behind Hands On Educare centre by donating old computers, printing and fax machines. The parents of the kids she teaches are not wealthy. Some will help rebuild the school but some just can t. There aren t a lot of disabled schools in East London. Where will our kids learn if we don t help, the parent said. zwangam@dispatch.co.za
