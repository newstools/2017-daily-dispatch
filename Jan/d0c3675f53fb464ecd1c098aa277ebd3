Despite the threat of being thrown into jail for 30 days, the mayor and municipal manager of Ingquza Hill local municipality have disobeyed a court order. Mayor Pat Mdingi and municipal manager Mluleki Fihlani have yet to provide temporary shelter to a group of Lusikisiki families whose homes were demolished.Grahamstown High Court Judge Judith Roberson had given Mdingi and Fihlani 10 days from December 29 to provide temporary shelters for the 40 New Rest families.Their houses were flattened by bulldozers four months ago, and although the municipality initially denied any blame for the demolitions, it agreed to a court order in mid-October that instructed it to provide shelter in New Rest for the 150 affected residents.At a second court appearance on December 29 the municipality conceded in court papers that it had failed to comply with the earlier court order.It argued that this was because it feared there would be more demolitions in New Rest carried out by a so-called third force .It had instead built alternative shelter in Slovo Park, 4km from New Rest.Speaking to the Daily Dispatch yesterday, affected resident Gcinithemba Ndila said the municipality had failed to provide the homeless residents with any form of help or shelter. We haven t heard a word from them. We are staying in a zinc shack which we built ourselves after a large tent which we had secured was damaged. We didn t even get a chance to enjoy Christmas, he said.Mdingi initially told the Dispatch the municipality had provided shelter for the families, but when told the court order had specifically ordered the accommodation be provided in New Rest and not elsewhere, he referred questions to Fihlani who could not be reached for comment.Municipal spokesman Zamuxolo Matwasa asked the Dispatch not to publish the report until at least today because the municipal offices only reopened for the year yesterday. We have to consult with the political and administrative leadership. We have to consolidate all the facts and speak with one voice. If I give you a comment, that would be haphazard, he said.Besides being ordered to provide alternative shelter to the 150 New Rest residents, the municipality was also ordered to pay the costs of the court application brought by the residents. sikhon@dispatch.co.za
