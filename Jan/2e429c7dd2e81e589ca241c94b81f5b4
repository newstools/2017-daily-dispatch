The DA on Wednesday described the leaked working document of Parliament s ad hoc committee on the SABC board inquiry as a good start and framework . However the party s Phumzile van Damme said much more work is needed for it to truly serve the purpose of steering the SABC to calm waters .The working document compiled following the conclusion of the committee s probe after the grilling of former chairpersons Dr Ben Ngubane and Ellen Tshabalala on Friday emerged online on Tuesday night.Van Damme noted that the document is in draft form and was circulated to members of the committee ahead of deliberations on Thursday . It is therefore subject to change. She said her party would be working on firm proposals that will not only steer the SABC to calm waters but hold those responsible for the mess the public broadcaster accountable .Among its recommendations were for a new interim SABC board to institute an investigation into all irregular fruitless and wasteful expenditure at the public broadcaster and that steps must be taken to recover these funds.It also was scathing of the interference of Communications Minister Faith Muthambi in the board s work including exerting undue pressure in the hasty permanent appointment of then acting COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng despite the public protector s damning findings against him.The document also hinted that the deal between the SABC and the Gupta-owned The New Age media outlet which gets paid for the televised TNA Biz Brief could be terminated .Van Damme commended the committee saying it has conducted itself firmly in a no-holds barred manner and it s recommendations need to also be thus . The DA looks forward to negotiating with the rest of the members of the Ad Hoc committee tomorrow.
