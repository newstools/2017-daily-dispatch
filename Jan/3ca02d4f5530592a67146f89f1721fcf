A 35-year-old taxi driver is fighting for his life in an undisclosed Eastern Cape hospital after he was shot and left wounded in an East London village. East London police spokeswoman, Warrant Officer, Hazel Mqala confirmed the incident, saying Luzuko Lali was shot while he was driving in Kidds Beach s Good Hope village, also known as Village 9. We can confirm that the taxi driver was shot several times and left wounded in Village 9 near Kidds Beach on Monday night. No arrests have been made yet, said Mqala. Lali s shooting comes a few days after another taxi operator, Xolile Baliso, 44, was shot and killed outside his NU 16 house on Wednesday. Baliso s killing was said to be linked to the ongoing taxi violence which that has claimed more than 15 lives between East London and Mthatha.
