Deon Botha, an elder at the East London Spirit &amp; Life Church, which bears a similar name to one run by miracle weight-loss pastor Jay Israel, has distanced his church from the controversial house of worship. Botha said many people were getting confused between his church and the Spirit Life Church run by Israel.This follows a report in the Daily Dispatch about the instant weight-loss prophet published on Monday.Israel posted online videos claiming to change water into wine, make money appear from nowhere and make people lose weight instantly.However, Botha s Spirit &amp; Life church said it had no connection to the Spirit Life Church or Jay Israel.Botha said the similarity in the names of the two churches has caused the confusion and compromised their church s credibility and integrity. Spirit &amp; Life Church is situated in Gonubie and has been around for 16 years and is known for its support to smaller churches in the Border region and some rural parts of the former Transkei, he said.
