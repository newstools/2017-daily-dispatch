The Rhodes University student alleged to be the mastermind behind the brutal torture and murder of a man he suspected of stealing his laptop, appeared briefly in a Grahamstown court today with his four co-accused. Thembani Onceya, 29, his brothers, Akhona and Simakele, and friends Sizwe Gqotholo and Mzwanele Maki appeared before magistrate Ntsoki Moni. The five are accused of kidnapping, torturing and killing Thembalani Qwakanisa after Onceya&#8217;s laptop went missing after a night of partying. There was huge public outrage after Qwakanisa&#8217;s body was found wrapped in a carpet in a township dam. All five men were refused bail late last year and have been in Waainek prison ever since. Thembani Onceya&#8217;s attorney Basil Williams today told the DispatchLIVE they were awaiting a high court date for his client&#8217;s appeal over the denial of bail to be heard. Prosecutor Lawrence Merrick earlier asked Moni to postpone the magistrate court murder trial until 3 March. The case has been postponed.
