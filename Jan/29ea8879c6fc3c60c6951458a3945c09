Authorities at the cash-strapped King Sabata Dalindyebo (KSD) municipality were forced to scramble together nearly R160 000 to pay off a debt owed to a local attorney after the sheriff of the court seized several computers, laptops, chairs and other office equipment. This was after they reportedly failed to have the labour court grant them an order to have the assets released by the sheriff. Mthatha attorney Hymie Zilwa told the Daily Dispatch that he had instructed a sheriff of the court to seize the assets as he is owed around R159 000 by KSD. The monies reportedly related to work he had done for the municipality in a labour court case involving an ex-municipal employee who was suing the municipality for unfair dismissal. &#8220;I submitted several invoices but they failed to pay,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have had a working relationship with the municipality spanning many years and I did not really want to do this. I am disappointed in the manner I was treated by them.&#8221; KSD municipal spokesman Sonwabo Mampoza confirmed that several assets had been seized on Friday.
