Matric results improved at three of the 10 schools in Libode which earlier in the year had been torched, pelted with stones and vandalised during protests. At others, the pass rate fell significantly.The pass rate languished below 50% at 22 of 43 high schools in the district, according to education department district director Thandeka Vikilahle.She praised their top scorer, Toli High, which received a 93.5% pass up from 92% in 2015On a further positive note, at Vakele Technical High the pass rate rose to 34% from 13% in 2015; at Majali Technical High it rose to 43% from 28% and at Vulindlela High it rose to 54% from 44%.But at Mhlanganisweni High it went into a freefall to 9% from 48% in 2015; at Nogemane High it slipped to 11% from 17%; at Sandi High it dropped to 28% from 39% and at Chief Henry Bokleni it went down to 24% from 35%.The saddest result, however, was registered by pupils of St Patrick s High at Gxulu Village which shone in 2014 with a 100% pass rate.But the rate dived to 73% in 2015 and is now sitting at 56%.People in the school community yesterday called the trend disappointing and embarrassing .The Dispatch visited the school and witnessed a mixture of mourning and jubilation. Some pupils were celebrating, while some teachers were seen with sad faces. We ve never had matric results below 60% in the history of this school. We have dropped almost 20 percentage points, deputy principal Alzinah Shinga said.This was confirmed by the school governing body chairman Lulamile Ncetywa who described the results as a disgrace .Shinga said 405 matrics had registered for the exam which was double the number of 2015. But 22 pupils either could not finish or did not even start writing the exam and only 383 completed the examination. A total of 222 passed, 161 failed and 110 will write supps, Shinga said.However, she was pleased with the school s 64 bachelor passes, 84 diploma passes and the 74 pupils who will receive higher certificates. We have seven distinctions. One of our pupils, Likho Makaula, is also one of the top achievers in the province and she obtained seven distinctions, she said.Mcetywa and Shinga said the protest in August had seen a classroom and 1000 desks torched.Some schools had not been able to write their trials because of the turmoil.Vakele Technical High principal Bonisile Mazuza said their results were better than expected.Majali Technical High principal Mkhuseli Fikizolo said: The improvement of more than 20 percentage points was good given the situation under which we operated in. After a fire at the school, we were displaced for two months and had to teach in prefabs when we returned. These collapsed and again we had no school. Mhlanganisweni High principal Thanduxolo Mntwini described the results as a disaster . The pupil strike lasted for almost three months. The pupils stopped attending school from August 4 and only returned on October 10, hence these disgraceful results. Vikilahle said the protests and infighting among teachers had impacted negatively on school results and education in the district. Even those who managed to improve, could have done better if it was not for those protest actions, Vikilahle said.The pass rate in Libode district was 47%, and 44% in Lusikisiki. lulamilef@dispatch.co.za
