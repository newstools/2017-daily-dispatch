By Graeme Hosken and Sipho MabenaSouth Africa s top cop is meeting his lawyers after the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) raided his home yesterday. The national Commissioner of Police, Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane, felt the search of his luxury estate house was traumatic for his family and an assault on his character.The raid was part of a broader investigation into corruption and defeating the ends of justice against Phahlane and kickbacks he allegedly received for awarding contracts to service providers.Directorate investigators met with Phahlane in his office yesterday to take a warning statement from him and serve him with a search warrant for his home in Pretoria s Sable Hills Waterkloof Estate at Roodeplaat Dam.Investigators spent an hour searching the R8-million property.Directorate spokesman Moses Dlamini declined to comment on the raid, saying it was part of an ongoing operation .Police spokesman Brigadier Sally De Beer confirmed Phahlane met with Ipid investigators at his office.De Beer said Phahlane had provided the Ipid investigators with the proof of payment for the sound system to the total value of R80075 the money having been transferred from his personal current account to Nedbank account number 1288095317 Sounds Great Woodlands on 16 April 2012 .She said the case of defeating the ends of justice related to allegations publicly made following an investigation and interviewing of witnesses led by Paul O Sullivan accompanied by Ipid investigators.The corruption allegations were in relation to the purchase of the sound system allegedly by co-directors of a private company.She said it was extremely regrettable that while five Ipid investigators were still busy with discussions in Phahlane s office news broke in the media that Ipid was in the process of raiding his home. Despite the acting National Commissioner providing personal proof of payment for the sound system a media circus was conducted at his place of residence including the spreading of propaganda through the electronic media causing further trauma to family members. It is against this background that the entire investigation is considered an assault on the character and integrity of the acting National Commissioner aimed at irreparably damaging his reputation and taking his focus away from the execution of his duties. The acting National Commissioner has briefed his lawyers to take this matter forward De Beer said. It is unfortunate that this investigation is being conducted through the media characterised by the distortion of facts disinformation and malice including an insult on the integrity of the acting National Commissioner and his family.
