A five-year-old Mdantsane boy whose body was slammed on to a tarred road by a suspected mentally ill man last Wednesday is still in coma fighting for his life. Families in the NU3 community where the attack happened have been left reeling with shock. Traumatised children are refusing to leave their homes to play outside.Lathitha Makeleni was rushed to Frere Hospital after sustaining serious head injuries.Speaking to the Dispatch yesterday, family spokeswoman Linda Makeleni said the boy was still unresponsive. A team of new doctors is consulting the doctors who were monitoring the situation to see if they might have missed anything, Makeleni said.The good news was that the swelling on the child s head and face had come down.Today Lathitha, who is on life support, will have been in a coma for a week.According to Makeleni, doctors will now insert a tube through Lathitha s trachea (in his throat) to help him breathe more easily. The doctors told me that they would remove the tube from the mouth and open a hole in his throat because they are worried that if it stays too long in the mouth, it might cause infections and he might start chewing it even though he is not conscious. The doctors have also been feeding him through tubes inserted into his nostrils.Two other boys in the area were also allegedly attacked by the same man.Imani Bali, six, who witnessed the attack on Lathitha, is refusing to play outside. Imani has been staying indoors ever since that brutal attack. He is scared to go outside because he saw that man attacking his friend. He has been crying non-stop, said Makeleni.Last week Frere Hospital chief executive Dr Rolene Wagner told the Daily Dispatch that Lathitha had been admitted to the hospital s paediatric ICU.Wagner said Lathitha was under the care of a team of paediatricians and neurosurgeons.The alleged attacker, Daluxolo Makhenke Nyovane, 27, was arrested immediately after the attack and has appeared before the Mdantsane Magistrate s Court on charges of attempted murder.Police spokesman Captain Mluleki Mbi said Nyovane was still in police custody and would be transferred to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation.Anyone who witnessed the incident or may have information that can assist police with the case can call the SAPS Crime Line anonymously on 08600-10111. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
