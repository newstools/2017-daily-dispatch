The Grahamstown High Court has dismissed convicted paedophile Bruce Ehrlich s bid to have the correctional service s decision to deny him parole set aside. Yesterday Judge Gerald Bloem refused the request with costs.Ehrlich, who was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on 14 counts of indecency and assaults to minor boys in 2003, was released on parole in 2010.He was sent back to prison on April 11 2016, after breaking his parole conditions. He was found to be playing squash with three or more boys at the Cambridge Sports Club, consuming alcohol and living with two young men aged 21 and 18, and three children aged 1, 6 and 14.On November 28 the board denied him parole after Ehrlich failed to produce birth certificates of minor boys he claimed he was informally fostering .The judge found that a 31-year-old man was one of the so-called foster children.Bloem said community corrections officials often saw minor boys in Ehrlich s house during their visits.An investigation by the parole board had also discovered he had left the East London magisterial district in violation of his parole.One of the parole conditions was that he was never to leave East London without permission from the parole board.Ehrlich, currently serving his sentence at the Mdantsane Correctional Centre, took the correctional services department and justice minister to court over the revocation of his parole.In his court papers Ehrlich, who at the time of his re-arrest was running a successful KwikPave business, said he had left East London in April for a few weeks to attend to his growing franchise in Port Elizabeth and Cape Town.He claimed the parole board was limiting his liberty unlawfully and that his KwikPave business in East London was losing money with him being behind bars.Erlich was convicted of similar offences in Knysna in the early 1990s. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
