Thandi , the Sunshine Coast rhino , who became a global anti &#8211; poaching icon after she miraculously survived having her horn hacked off five years ago, has given birth to a second calf. The birth of the unnamed calf came at a time when family and friends were mourning the death of Kariega Game Reserve founder Colin Rushmere 10 days ago. Rushmere&#8217;s son Mark today told the Daily Dispatch that they never knew Thandi was pregnant when she disappeared and they feared she may have been hit a second time by poachers. &#8220;For all we know, the calf was born on the same day Dad died, we could not find her for a while and were worried. &#8220;It is all very symbolic.&#8221;
