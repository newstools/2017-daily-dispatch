Two occupants of the truck were uninjured.Meanwhile, the ANC in the Eastern Cape has expressed shock and sadness following Nombembe&#8217;s death who was also a Progressive Youth in Business member.ANC provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane said Nombembe would be remembered for his efforts to improve the lives of the poor people. His energy will be remembered in the party and in business, as young as he was, he was very responsible and progressive. Mabuyane said Nombembe would be missed by his wife and children whom he adored and lived for.At the time of his death Nombembe was a subject for investigation by the Hawks over allegations of a fraudulent business deal with Mnquma Municipality. Former Mnquma municipal manager Sindile Tantsi, who also died in an accident earlier this year, was implicated in the fraud.The Dispatch reported in February about Tantsi s links to Nombembe, whose company Big Event Boy (Pty) Ltd, was paid R10-million for supplying black plastic bags. The company won the tender to supply the municipality with refuse bags two years ago.
