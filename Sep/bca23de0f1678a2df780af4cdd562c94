Seven people have been killed in two separate accidents on Eastern Cape roads this morning. Four people died 30km outside Graaff-Reinet when the mini-bus taxi they were travelling in collided with a truck. Provincial health department spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said the taxi was travelling from Cape Town to Mount Flere.  He said one male and three females were confirmed dead on arrival at Midland Hospital.   Three people died in an accident at Emaqhinebeni outside Mthatha this morning. While Kupelo could confirm the accident, he was awaiting further details. In another incident, a police van collided with an ambulance in Rosedale Street, Amalinda, East London, in the early hours of today. “The police van skipped the robots resulting in a collision with an ambulance rushing a five-year-old patient to Frere Hospital.’’ No one was injured.
