I ndustry experts are proceeding with great concern after Avian flu was detected in the Eastern Cape this week as there may be a shortage of chicken and eggs in the near future. Alwyn Krull of Sunrise Eggs in Gonubie said Avian flu was a huge threat in the industry. I do see a shortage of chicken and eggs if this is not managed and controlled, Krull said. Greg White of ANCA Foods in Stutterheim described the new detection in the province as an issue of concern . It is more concerning now because it is closer to home. We are all very concerned about what is going to happen in the upcoming months,&#8221; he said. On Thursday Sovereign Foods in Uitenhage announced that they had detected bird flu on their farm. About 5000 chickens had been culled. They have six poultry houses and each of them has about 4500 birds. T he Rural Development and Agrarian Reform&#8217;s provincial veterinary services chief director Dr Lubabalo Mrwebi said: &#8220; F arms within the 30 km radius would be under strict veterinary surveillance to minimi s e any possible spread of the highly pathogenic Avian Influenza to other farms.&#8221;
