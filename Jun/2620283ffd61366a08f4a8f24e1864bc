Hundreds of Walter Sisulu University students are demonstrating around Southernwood in East London this morning. Part of St Peters Street between Oxford and Webb streets has been closed. Police and law enforcement officers are monitoring the situation. The students have boycotted classes since last week over NSFAS allowances. They will later gather at St James Park to discuss a way forward.
