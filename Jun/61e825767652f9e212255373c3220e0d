The two accused in the much- publicised rape and murder cases of two women and the rape of a school pupil in Mdantsane pleaded with the court not to give them bail, fearing that the community would kill them. Both men appeared yesterday in the Mdantsane Magistrate s Court for a formal bail application.One of the men is charged with the rape of a minor, while the other is charged with three counts of murder and rape.Details of the third charge of murder were still unclear to the Dispatch at the time of going to print yesterday.National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Tshepo Ndwalaza said the case was postponed until July 28 for further investigation.The men were arrested following the discovery of two bodies at the bottom of a cliff near Mdantsane s Daluxolo Township.The bodies were found by angry community members who were chasing a suspect believed to have raped a young school pupil.Following a DNA test and postmortem, the two women were identified as Lindi Malote, 19, and Bongiwe Matoyo, 27.Malote was a Grade 12 pupil at Wongalethu Secondary School.Their funerals will be held today in Mdantsane s NU2.The murders left the community enraged and during the bail hearing the media and the public were barred from entering the courtroom by an army of police officers.About 15 police officers stood outside the courtroom, while more than 10 were inside the court.Department of Justice Security Division head, Sinethemba Langa, who oversaw the security at court, told the media to apply for permission from the court manager.Only a few members of the public were allowed inside the courtroom.Langa told the Dispatch that members of the angry crowd had made special arrangements with the investigating officer and senior state prosecutor.Court manager Melanie Elliot and senior state prosecutor V Mazibuko were cited as instituting the stringent security measures.However, Elliot and Mazibuko denied being responsible for banning the media from the court.This was the second time in the case that the public, including the media, were barred from court proceedings.Elliot told the Dispatch that this was due to security threats posed by an overwhelming public interest in the case.On Thursday, more than 300 people who came in buses and taxis were locked outside the court.The Dispatch sent questions to the department of justice but did not get a response at the time of writing yesterday.The provincial police denied responsibility and referred the Dispatch to the justice department.Cambridge police spokesman Captain Mluleki Mbi confirmed yesterday that the state had organised a burial for both of the murdered women. malibongwed@dispatch.co.za
