The Festival is also instrumental in raising meaningful funding for local charities (over R3 million in 2016) and for developing and growing local suppliers. These are good reasons for the Festival to take place and an even better reason to invite everyone to Knysna this year.To illustrate the positive economic impact that the festival brings to Knysna last year festival goers spent close to R110 million over the 10 days of the Festival excluding event tickets and a total of 2 392 job opportunities were created.Separate to the charitable contributions that will come from the Festival both Pick n Pay and event co-sponsors Momentum have this week each donated R100 000 to immediate fire disaster relief.In the meantime anyone wishing to assist can take advantage of Pick n Pay s online shop to purchase groceries and essentials for delivery to those in need.
