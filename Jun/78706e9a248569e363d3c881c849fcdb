A would-be practicing nurse collapsed while protesting outside Eastern Cape department of health offices in Bhisho at about 9.30am this morning. &nbsp;Nwabisa Songolo, 30, from Peddie was part of a group of more than 150 nursing graduates who have been sleeping near Dukumbana offices in Bhisho since Tuesday in protest against the department&#8217;s failure to absorb them as fulltime nurses.Most of the protesters received bursaries to do nursing through the state-funded Lilitha College of nursing.The woman had been sleeping outside for the past two days. This morning at around 8am she felt a sharp pain on her back which forced her to sit infront of the Dakumbana building and cover herself with blankets.At around 9am the pain intensified so much that she fell unconcious.The other nurses called the ambulance at 9.30am, but it only arrived at 10.50am.Thembinkosi Qwakanisa, an eye-witness said Songololo could have succumbed to the cold they were enduring while waiting for the MEC for Health Phumza Dyantyi to come and address them.The protesters are also demanding that the department absorb them after having trained them.
