ANC provincial bosses in Calata House will decide on Monday whether party members can nominate their preferred candidates to contest as leaders at the provincial elective conference scheduled for next month. But for now the conference, which is likely to be held in East London, is in the hands of secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, who has to first sign off on the membership audits which will, in turn, confirm which branches are eligible to take part in the election of the new provincial leaders.ANC provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane confirmed to the Dispatch this week that only Mantashe s signature stands in the way of branch general meetings discussing the kind of leaders the province wants and who should be delegates at the provincial conference next month. We are having a PEC [provincial executive committee] meeting on Monday, where we expect audit outcomes to be tabled. Once we receive the signed audit report from the SG, only thereafter will we be able to give the go-ahead for branch general meetings for the elective conference, said Mabuyane.The contest is likely to be a two-horse race between the main contenders for the provincial chairman position current secretary Oscar Mabuyane and incumbent chair Phumulo Masualle, who is likely to contest for a third term.A third lobby group raised former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas s name at a meeting held at the OR Tambo community hall in Zwelitsha on Friday.Jonas supporters want former ANC MPL Phila Nkayi to replace Mabuyane as provincial secretary, while Mabuyane s supporters are divided between Lulama nominating Ngcukayithobi and the ANC youth league s Mziwonke Ndabeni as provincial secretary.The third group wants to field Nelson Mandela Bay metro s Andile Lungisa to serve with Masualle as provincial secretary.Other names being touted for the position of secretary include Intsika Yethu municipal manager Zamuxolo Shasha and former Sakhisizwe municipal manager and youth activist Thembeni Steshi Samuel.Mabuyane said only the signed audit report from Mantashe s office could give the green light for ANC branches to nominate their preferred candidates. We have to follow due process. The ANC has a constitution and we have to follow its guidelines, said Mabuyane. Only the PEC will be able to give the go-ahead for such nominations by branches, he added.
