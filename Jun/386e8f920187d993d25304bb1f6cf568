Gospel singer Malibongwe Gcwabe treated his fans to a vibrant performance at the launch of his 16th album at the Orient Theatre on Sunday afternoon. The new album is titled Ndiwabonile Amandla Akho. Other artists who blessed the audience with their talent included Zwelitsha-born singer Veliswa Skeyi, Reverend Nkomfa and legendary singer and composer Sipho Makhabane.Makhabane recorded Gcwabe s debut album, Umlilo kaJesu, in 2003 under his label, Amanxusa Music.Gcwabe started his career as a co-lead singer of the gospel outfit Youth With Mission, which was formed in Mdantsane in the mid-90s.After releasing six albums with the group, he left to focus on his solo career. Gcwabe has released popular songs such as Siyakudumisa, Taru Bawo, Enkosi Bawo.Speaking to the Dispatch, Gcwabe who is now a pastor of Remnant Ministries, a church he established 10 years ago, said he was happy about the love and support from his fans. I am where I am today because of their unconditional support, he said.Gcwabe described his musical journey as one of ups and downs. Some of my albums, such as Calvary and some others were hits, but others were not that successful. That is part of the journey, he said.He said the album was about his personal encounter with God. Like the Samaritan woman who had an encounter with Jesus, she left her water jar in the well and went back to her town to tell people about her encounter. In this album, I am telling people about the love of God and his faithfulness, he said.He added his fans could expect the same style, but with a few new elements. It is the same Gcwabe they know, but with much growth, he said.He is soon to start travelling the country to promote the album. On Tuesday I will be leaving for the Western Cape and when I come back, I will go around the Eastern Cape and then again go to other provinces.
