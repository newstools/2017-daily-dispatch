Nyameko High in Mdantsane NU8 yesterday received a generous R10000 from Transnet National Port Authorities (TNPA) East London Port (TNPA) and the South African Navy to furnish their computer lab. The cheque was presented to the principal by the school s past pupil Rear Admiral Nomonde Gigi and Captain Gugu Dube.When the School Nutrition Programme was introduced to the school in 2015, the school was forced to give up its computer lab to have a kitchen.TNPA and the navy then donated a container that was developed into a kitchen.Nyameko principal Thulani Mahlambeni said they were delighted by the continued support from TNPA and the Navy. We were still thinking where we will get money to buy chairs for the computer lab? Our computer lab has been without chairs, so the school management and the governing body have decided to invest the money in something that will benefit the future of the pupils. Our pupils will now be able to utilise the lab and be equipped with the necessary computer skills that they need for the workplace, said Mahlambeni. Sisipho Zamxaka
