Buffalo City Metro has insisted its electricity helpline numbers are working fine, but for a bit of congestion during outages. Last Thursday, during an outage in Mdantsane, a reporter tried for two hours to call the only advertised electricity fault number, (043)763-8656. An automated message replied: The network is busy .BCM communications official Bathandwa Diamond later said a second number, (043)708-5600, was also available to the public.A Dispatch check on BCM s website and Facebook page revealed no sign of this number.In a further revelation for weary ratepayers trying to get after-hours service, it turns out the promise of a 24-hour customer care centre is limited to a 24-hour call-in system.The walk-in customer care system only operates between 7am and 5pm, but it does so seven days a week , said Diamond.The Dispatch tested this out and tried to visit the 24-hour centre after hours but was denied entry by security at the gate.Diamond said: Access to the centre is possible between 7am and 5pm, seven days a week. However, it is not a 24-hour walk-in centre, it is a 24-hour telephonic fault reporting centre. Diamond conceded that the lines became jammed at times. The number (043)763-8656 is not malfunctioning but is congested during peak periods and that is why (043)708-5600 is available. This number is not on the BCM website, nor their Facebook page; nor the billboard outside the customer care centre in Fort Jackson.Diamond said: We have 20 telephone lines coming into the call centre, four of which are on (043)763-8656 and 16 on (043)708-5600. Both have been communicated to the departments and councillors and listed on the social media site.
