Public safety is one of our priorities in terms of the 10 priorities that we have identified as the metro. So we want to ensure that we deal with the criminal element, particularly in public places, said Pakati.The installation of the Esplanade CCTV network cost BCM R1.8-million and R10-million was spent for the CBD connection.In the city s new camera control room at the Fleet Street fire station, plasma TVs clearly showed what was happening in the East London CBD and Esplanade yesterday.The Mdantsane highway rank cameras were not working yesterday due to strong winds that had affected the system over the weekend, said public safety portfolio head Amanda Mnyute.She said for now the cameras were live in the CBD, Esplanade and Mdantsane. However, the project will be rolled out in other areas including Southernwood and Leaches Bay.In March the Daily Dispatch reported that the cameras were installed at the following intersections:&nbsp;The cameras operate on Wi-Fi and solar energy to save electricity and work when there is neither electricity nor a Wi-Fi connection, the Dispatch reported.
