Imagination, creativity, and uniqueness are on full display at the Belgravia Arts School after pupils from more than 20 schools in East London submitted their visual artworks for the Buffalo City Eisteddfod EL Fest 2017. Cambridge, Gonubie, Clarendon, Stirling, Hudson Park, George Randall and Selborne are just a few primary and high schools participating in this year s exhibition.The exhibition commenced on June 12 for the arts section, while the drama, poetry and music sections will be held in July.Celebrating different disciplines under visual arts, more than 900 entries are on display at the arts school.An array of crafted, painted and sculpted artworks by Grade 1 to 12 pupils can be viewed.Most of the artworks are from the primary schools, which school principal Terry Schultz said was impressive. It is encouraging to see a variety and diversity of artworks each year. There is more room for investment into visual arts in East London, which will be stronger if cultivated in primary schools. Strength in visual arts at primary level leads to a ripple effect in high school and beyond. The adjudication of the artworks took place last week Saturday, with each work being graded and awarded, from bronze up to double gold-plus level.Cambridge Primary took to Facebook to express their excitement over their pupils performances. The school s foundation and intermediate phase jointly bagged 21 double gold, 19 gold and 16 silver awards.Hudson Park High also had reason to brag, as their artworks bagged five double gold, 14 gold and 30 silver awards.Schultz said parents needed to be educated about the importance of visual arts. It is equally important for parents to be enlightened about what pupils can do with visual arts. It carries weight even at tertiary level when they pursue degrees such as architecture and graphic design. It isn t merely a soft-and-easy subject. The art exhibition is open from 8.30am to 3.30pm daily, until Friday. Entrance is free.
