Mthatha property mogul Sisa Ngebulana celebrated his 51st birthday by donating more than R1-million for the construction of classrooms with a computer lab at an Mthatha village school, along with food parcels for the underprivileged.To celebrate his birthday on Thursday, Ngebulana, of the Billion Group, visited his old school, Ntaphane Junior Secondary School in Corhana village, near Mthatha, to officiate at a sod-turning where he will be building six classrooms, a fully-fledged computer-lab, hall and administration block.He left the school 35 years ago after finishing Standard 6, before matriculating at St Johns College in Mthatha.Principal Noxolo Pohlwana and traditional leader Nkosi Zwelivumile Ntapane were amazed by the donation.The Corhana-born businessman believes the wealth and success he has amassed is a gift from God and he wants to share it with others.He is the second prominent figure to donate to their alma maters in Mthatha recently.Three weeks ago, international 1 s and 2 s man DJ Black Coffee (Nathi Maphumulo) visited Zimele High School, where he passed Grade 8.The DJ officially opened a R200000 computer lab he donated to the Khwezi township school.Both men remain humble and spread the same message: that young people should not let their background cloud their dreams.Ngebulana spent almost the whole day visiting schools, children s and old age homes and villages, handing over food and warm winter blankets to impoverished Mthatha, Ngqeleni and Libode residents.This was undertaken by Ngebulana s newly launched philanthropic organisation, the Sisa Ngebulana Foundation. A lot has been given to me by God, hence giving to others gives me peace, Ngebulana said.The magnate was accompanied by his girlfriend Ayanda Zulu, his sisters and foundation members including project manager Reverend Jongikhaya Skhuni, as he visited the areas and handed out food and blankets. We tend to forget about others, but only concentrate on the warmth and comfort of our homes while many go to bed with empty stomachs and others do not even have a single blanket. When we eat, we forget those who are hungry and in need. But we must share the little we have with those who don t, said Ngebulana.On Wednesday, Ngebulana officially opened his four-star, R130-million Mayfair Hotel, adjacent to the his R1.4-billion BT Ngebs City regional mall in Mthatha.Also, as part of celebrating his birthday, about 100 family members from all over the country, as well as colleagues, had a celebratory dinner. I can afford the finest things in the world, but I decided to spend my day here and this is very special to me. My soul is here in Mthatha. I grew up here and I still have lots of ambitions to take Mthatha to a different level and make an impact in the lives of people in the process, said Ngebulana. lulamilef@dispatch.co.za
