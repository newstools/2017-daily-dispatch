It seems judgement day for sports presenter Robert Marawa s career at the SABC may be very close. The presenter s fate has been uncertain at the public broadcaster for a while now and he is set to attend a meeting with his bosses this week.Speaking to TshisaLIVE Robert said he had been told of a meeting on Wednesday for which he is awaiting confirmation. There is a meeting I was told of planned for Wednesday. It was initiated by the SABC but I am not certain who will attend that meeting or what the agenda of the meeting is. The meeting is also yet to be confirmed he said.Sunday World has previously reported that the SABC s group executive for sports Sully Motsweni has been unhappy with Robert s behaviour and has informed senior executives that she plans to summon the presenter to a meeting. Robert dismissed this and told TshisaLIVE he would not comment on hearsay. I wouldn t know or comment on things that have not been said to my face. I also don t know what behaviour they are referring to because I go to the SABC do my job then go home. I also don t have time for hearsay he said.The sports presenter took to Twitter to vent his frustrations over the public broadcaster s decision to suspend his producer Beverly Maphangwa. He shared that he would remove himself from the show until the matter is sorted out.
