Many hands can clean Buffalo City this is the rallying cry of the Call2Action programme spearheaded by the metro working with the Border-Kei Chamber of Business to combat waste in the city. Yesterday the campaign, first discussed in May last year, was officially launched at Heroes Park on the Esplanade in Quigney shortly after a media and stakeholder briefing at the Garden Court hotel.Border-Kei Chamber of Business director Les Holbrook said the joint venture made sense for businesses and the municipality. We had to move from our offices in Southernwood over the years because we couldn t invite high-profile business people and international ambassadors to our offices and expect them to speak highly of our town and what it has to offer when we are greeted with garbage on our very doorstep, Holbrook said. Investors want to invest in a city on the move and that s what we are working towards. We are now a city that is doing something about our surroundings and that speaks volumes to people looking for business or looking to invest in the city. Garden Court manager Ian Mackay said they were tasked by Tsogo Sun management to get involved in community initiatives We were experiencing deterioration in the cleanliness of the area and other parts of Quigney which is why we as a business decided to do our part by contributing to the cleanliness of our surroundings, the beachfront and Quigney, Mackay said.BCM portfolio head for municipal services Helen Neale-May said this was the second leg of the campaign, after the first was initiated at West Bank.BCM development agency board member John Badenhorst encouraged residents to take pride in their town and play a role in the clean-up. There are two types of people those who are always complaining about how nothing is going right and nothing works, and those who are just happy to be in a beautiful town and play their part to keep the town beautiful. Be the one who takes pride in their town and keeps it clean, he said.
