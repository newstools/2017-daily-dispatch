The Public Protector has ordered North West premier Supra Mahumapelo to approach the Special Investigating Unit to probe more than R255-million in irregular payments related to the mining royalties missing from Bapo Ba Mogale s D-Account.

This was well above the budgeted amount of R29.8million with Mkhwebane saying there was gross misuse of funds by the North West department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs with the amount exceeding the budget by R85-million and with no reasons advanced for the huge increase.The report also reveals how a further R21.5-million was paid to Ndzalama interiors for the decoration of the palace during the construction and another R8.7-million paid to consultants ProjexConsult for the construction of the palace.
