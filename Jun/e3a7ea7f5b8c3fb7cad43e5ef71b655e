The Minister in the Presidency, Jeff Radebe, is expected to give the keynote address at the groundbreaking launch of the first Black Business Forum (BBF) in East London today. The BBF is a non-profit organisation that aims to address challenges faced by many black-owned businesses across the country , said co-founder Mtheza Buya.The forum will be officially launched at 6pm at the East London Independent Development Zone.It is here that what Buya described as concerned Eastern Cape black business, policymakers and industrialists leaders from their respective institutions of all sizes , will discuss a programme of action going forward.To mark the historic event, along with Radebe will be Eastern Cape premier Phumulo Masualle, as well as Buffalo City Metro mayor Xola Pakati, among others.The launch comes a few years after Afrikaans speaking South Africans decided to form AfriForum which, under the umbrella of trade union Solidarity, champions what it describes as the interests of minority groups.AfriForum has also challenged various senior government appointments they viewed as having undermined the interests of Afrikaners in favour of affirmative action (AA), a government policy aiming to address injustices of the past in the workplace in favour of blacks and women in particular.But local black business umbrellas such as Nafcoc have been crying foul, saying the state is not fully implementing its AA policy, as some companies continue to use black people and businesses as fronts to win tenders.In the Eastern Cape, treasury MEC Sakhumzi Somyo announced in his policy speech in March that the state would do more to favour black businesses going forward and Eastern Cape ones in particular across government departments and municipalities.But in an interview, Buya said they had yet to see the reality of this as local businesses since the announcement three months ago.Of great concern were that businesses from other provinces continued to secure lucrative state tenders in the province.Another founder of the forum, Luthando Bara, said the BBF would also serve as a platform to address the development and growth of black-owned businesses . This will also help black businesses to participate in the self-determination, growth and prosperity of black communities, thereby creating a strong economic base that nurtures, powers and supports the development of these communities and our province, added Bara.Contact Phelisa at 043 7351302.
