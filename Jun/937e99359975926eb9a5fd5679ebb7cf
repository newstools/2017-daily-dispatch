School pupils cultivated the gift of giving this month when they gave back to organisations fighting worthy causes for little ones in the East London community. The Selborne College family rallied to partake in the worthy cause of fighting cancer and raised over R150000 for children s cancer home CHOC.Selborne parent Peter Mcloughlin initiated the #SelborneScrumsCancer campaign, and through a partnership with the school along with local businessmen, they creatively sought ways to raise funds and create more awareness in an effort to save more lives.The annual Selborne-Queens Derby that was held on May 6 turned into a pink affair as big banners, T-shirts, flags and caps were sold to companies, parents and community members. All the proceeds were given over to CHOC manager Debbie Kleinenberg, who received it with great appreciation. It is the dream of any NGO to receive assistance of such magnitude, she said.Mcloughlin said he was grateful to have been able to be part of a team that had made a difference. We hope this is the start of something that will last. We are raising awareness of a disease we believe can one day be cured. Clarendon also taught their little ones to put a smile on the faces of their mates fighting battles of different kinds at Frere Hospital s paediatric orthopaedic and oncology wards. After the school s annual games day, the parents of the Grade 00 class and the school s management decided to donate toys, blankets and other treats.Frere CEO Dr Rolene Wagner said: Being in hospital is never an experience we necessarily choose to have; even more so for little, active children. And so a visit like this brightens up their day. And like any child, our children hospitalised at Frere love receiving gifts and sweet goodies! Frere hospital is grateful for the very special spirit and the generosity that we have in the East London community.
