A shocked silence descended over expectant Border cricket staff at Buffalo Park yesterday afternoon when they found out that East London would not be a host city for the exciting inaugural T20 Global Destination League in December. Eleven cities were in the running to host the eight teams.With the six franchise team cities Bloemfontein (Knights), Tshwane (Titans), Johannesburg (Lions), Cape Town (Cobras), Durban (Dolphins) and Port Elizabeth (Warriors) all expected to become hosts it was left to East London, Paarl, Potchefstroom, Benoni and Kimberley to battle it out for the last two places.In the end Benoni and Paarl received the nod, which came as a shock to cricket fans.Benoni being named in particular was a big surprise as along with Johannesburg and Tshwane it made for three teams in extremely close proximity.Paarl was also a surprise due to its proximity to Cape Town. We are obviously feeling a bit sad at the announcement. However, we will support the other venues with some of the staff members expected to travel to other venues to assist and to share the experience with those who will be part of the cricket history, said CEO of Border Cricket Thando Booi.He thanked Buffalo City Metro executive mayor Xola Pakati and his executive for their support during the bidding process.Each team is guaranteed two players of international standard, one foreign and another from South Africa in their side.It leaves a bitter taste as East London and Border Cricket have done a massive amount towards transformation in cricket and to become one of the host cities would have been deserved.However, cricket fans in the region will now have to follow the action from their televisions when the league gets underway.International marquee players Chris Gayle, Kieron Pollard and Dwayne Bravo (West Indies), Kevin Peterson, Eoin Morgan and Jason Roy (England), Lasith Malinga (Sri Lanka) and Brendon McCullum (New Zealand) will be split between the eight teams.Proteas stars were drafted, with AB de Villiers joining Benoni, as well as Hashim Amla (Durban), Quinton de Kock (Benoni), JP Duminy (Cape Town), Faf du Plessis (Paarl), David Miller (Bloemfontein), Kagiso Rabada (Johannesburg) and Imran Tahir (Port Elizabeth).During the announcement yesterday CSA president Chris Nenzani said: Competition was stiff, with more than 150 expressions of interest received from around the world and a shortlist of heavy hitters to consider, but after rigorous discussions and engagement with each of the potential owners, we are certain that our final eight owners have the perfect combination of strategic insight and passion needed to make the first T20 Global League a complete success.
