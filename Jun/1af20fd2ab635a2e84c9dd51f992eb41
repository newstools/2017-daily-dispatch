The national department of water and sanitation needs R115-billion to supply water and sanitation to the people of the Eastern Cape up to 2035. The amount includes R95-billion to ensure smooth operation of the water supply system, and R19.1-billion for sanitation provision.This is while the department also needs R66.5-billion a year for water services projects already in the pipeline, with R48-billion of that required for water services and R18.5-billion for sanitation.This was revealed yesterday by the department s provincial head Portia Makhanya, when she presented the province s draft water and sanitation infrastructure master plan at their provincial office in King William s Town.Makhanya said it would take the department at least 11 years to deal with the water services projects backlog, as the annual allocation of R5.6-billion in infrastructure grants was not enough to fast-track the backlog.For the full story get a copy of the Dispatch or subscribe to our e-Edition for the complete newspaper with jobs, classifieds, crosswords, TV schedules and back editions
