The SuperSport Rugby Challenge takes centre stage at Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane tomorrow, with three top matches to provide plenty of entertainment. Headlining the day s action will be a cracking encounter between hosts, the Border Bulldogs and Western Province.The Bulldogs currently sit second on the South section log, nine points behind the unbeaten Province side, and if they lose, they could find the Eastern Province Kings and the Boland Kavaliers reeling them in. It is an important match for us, if we can get the win we will be a lot more comfortable and in a great position to make the quarterfinals, but if we lose it will put us in a battle with the other teams, Bulldogs coach David Dobela said.The last time the teams met in April, Province emerged with a solid 50-34 win in Cape Town.With 84-points and 11 tries scored in that match between the two teams, tomorrow s game is all set to be an exciting try fest. I think it will be an open attacking match, Dobela said. Both teams have very good attacking players and it should be an interesting battle between the backlines. But I think it will come down to whose forwards can put in the best effort and give the backs frontfoot ball to play off, he added. Lock Lindokuhle Welemu will be key among the forwards and will be aiming to lead by example.Adding some excitement, is the fact that wing Michael Makase and scrumhalf Bangi Kobese will be making their 50th appearances which could spur them on to a big effort.In other matches, the EP Kings are up against the South Western District Eagles, who are are the only team left in this year s competition who have yet to win a match.The Kings currently sit six points behind the Bulldogs, so a bonus point win would put them just a point behind them before the day s main game, which could heap even more pressure on the home side.With the Kavaliers having the weekend off, they will have a game in hand over all the teams in the South Section pool and since they trail the Bulldogs by just four points, they could move up into second once they catch up.The other game on show on the day, is a massive Border Super League club derby between Swallows and Winter Rose.The day gets underway with Swallows v Winter Rose at 11am.Tickets for the festival are free and can be collected from the Sisa Dukashe stadium throughout the day today.Tickets will also be available at Sisa Dukashe tomorrow but if the stadium is filled to capacity, some fans may be turned away. The gates will open at 9am tomorrow.
