The tables have turned in the ANC s Chris Hani region after branches overturned the decision of their Regional Executive Committee (REC) to support Phumulo Masualle as ANC provincial chairman in the upcoming conference. Branches in Chris Hani have instead endorsed Oscar Mabuyane to take over the top job.This happened at the weekend when the region s branches convened at the Gali Thembani Hall in Komani to discuss ANC policy documents ahead of the party s provincial and national policy conferences later this month.Chris Hani regional secretary Lusanda Sizani yesterday told the Dispatch that indeed branches corrected the REC from its status quo position on the provincial conference when it had resolved to support Masualle staying on as chairman while it wanted Mabuyane to carry on as provincial secretary.For the full story get a copy of the Dispatch or subscribe to our e-Edition for the complete newspaper with jobs, classifieds, crosswords, TV schedules and back editions
