The C-Club in Chintsa was the place to be this weekend when South African Music Awards-nominated musician Matthew Mole performed to a crowd of more than 1400 people. This was the C-Club s biggest event ever. It also featured East London band Can of Worms and Jason Gladwin, and both outfits gave of their best.Gladwin, a well-known indie-folk singer, had the crowd singing along to his popular track, Keep You Warm. The video is sitting at more than 100000 views on YouTube. Gladwin released his debut album, Untamed, last year and has been travelling all over the country doing shows.Cape Town-based Mole did not disappoint as young and old cheered and danced to his music.Mole made his debut in 2011 with his first EP, You Did Well, Kid.His first album, The Home We Built, followed in 2013 earning him a couple of nominations for Sama and MK awards. His second album, Run, was released last year and earned him another Sama nomination for best pop album.C-Club owner Mark Crawford was elated at the success of the event. We are grateful to the people for coming out to support, he said.The open-air stage allowed everyone in attendance to hear and see the artists as they performed.Crawford said the only small fly in the ointment had been rather long queues at the bar areas. The bar areas were all packed but it is expected because of the large number of people that came, he said.Crawford said people were already asking when the next big thing would be taking place at the C-Club. The feedback has been awesome. We will be having an event again on June 24 but it won t be as big, he said.Crawford is planning a gin festival featuring The Lucas Reunion, Aston Wylie (from the first season of The Voice SA) and Gladwin. We will have crafts and a bar outside and we will have our own infused gin and some from around the country, he said. Crawford urged gin festival supporters to dress up.
