The Amahlathi Cri sis Com mit tee rep re sent ing eight vil lages near King William&#8217;s Town will ask the Bhisho High Court on Tuesday to set aside the deci sion of the Com mis sion on Tra di tional Lead er ship Dis putes and Claims and of the Pre mier that recog nises the legit i macy of a chief. The Amahlathi Cri sis Com mit tee which is objecting to a chieftainship they say was first imposed them in 1982 is rep re sented by the Legal Resources Cen tre.Sketching the background the LRC said the peo ple of Amahlathi arrived in the area that they occupy today in the 1850s.&#8220;They had no chief but gov erned them selves through a sys tem of elected chair per sons and have con tin ued to prac tice this cus tom ary law until today. How ever in 1982 Pres i dent (Lennox) Sebe of the then Ciskei cre ated a chief tain ship over the area and installed Mr (Lent) Maqoma . . . as chief.&#8220;The com mu nity ignored this new devel op ment as far as they could at the time so much so that the posi tion dis ap peared around 2000. How ever in 2005 with the pro mul ga tion of the East ern Cape Tra di tional Lead er ship and Gov er nance Act of 2005 &#8221; the LRC said the Maqoma chief taincy reasserted its author ity over the area.The Amahlathi peo ple took their griev ance about the chieftainship to sev eral gov ern ment depart ments before being advised to lodge a com plaint with the Com mis sion. The Com mis sion the Amahlathi peo ple say mis con strued their man date. Instead of inves ti gat ing whether the cus tom ary law of the com mu ni ties of Amahlathi pro vides for a chief they focused on the his tory of the land in ques tion and insisted that an antecedent of Maqoma had author ity over the area before the Amahlathi peo ple arrived there.The com mu nity is ask ing the Bhisho High Court to set aside the deci sion to con firm the Maqoma chief taincy and to order that the area can not be placed under the author ity of a chief as long as it is incon sis tent with the cus tom ary law of the peo ple who live there.The office of Pre mier Phumulo Masualle and the Com mis sion ini tially opposed the appli ca tion but have since with drawn their oppo si tion and stated they will abide by the court s deci sion the LRC said.
