President Jacob Zuma did not have to consult the amaMpondo royal family when he acted on the Nhlapho Commission recommendations and declared Zanozuko Sigcau as the legitimate king, the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein has ruled. The SCA last week handed down the judgment dismissing an appeal against an order of North Gauteng High Court by amaMpondo s Princess Wezizwe Sigcau and her mother Queen MaSobhuza Sigcau.They are the daughter and widow of the late Mpondombini Sigcau, the erstwhile paramount chief of Eastern Mpondoland (amaMpondo AseQaukeni).They took Zuma to court accusing him of interfering in the sovereignty of the nation because he did not consult the royal family before accepting the Nhlapo Commission s recommendation which found Zanozuko Sigcau to be the legitimate king of all amaMpondo and found that Mpondombini was irregularly appointed when made king of Eastern Mpondoland in 1979.Last week the SCA confirmed the November 2015 North Gauteng decision that Zuma did not have to consult the royal family and dismissed the appeal by Wezizwe and her mother.At the centre of their appeal was a decision by the Nhlapo Commission on the rightful king.Wezizwe s attorney, Ayanda Ngubo said they would appeal the SCA decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zanozuko s spokesman Prince Mzwandile Maraqana said the coronation on October 12 would go ahead. lulamilef@dispatch.co.za
