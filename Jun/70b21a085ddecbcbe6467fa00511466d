A body of an un identified man was discovered by horrified residents this morning buried under a pile of rubbish in St Peters Road in Southernwood. Thick blood traces signalling that the body dragged for about a metre from the pavement into the rubbish led the police to the gruesome discovery. Police cordoned off the area for more than an hour while a police forensic expert took photographs. According to street vendors the body could be of a popular car &#8211; guard who used to operate at the nearby Muir Street. Beatrice Meseh,32, who was going out to buy bread for her little children at 8am, said she was greeted by blood traces on the pavement outside the St Peters Court gates. Police were still clearing the scene when the Dispatch LIVE left at about 10am this morning.
