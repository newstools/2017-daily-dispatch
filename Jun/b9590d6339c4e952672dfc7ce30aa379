Aid organisation Gift of the Givers on Friday paid tribute to victims of the devastating Knysna fires which ripped through large swathes of the Western Cape town recently. Hundreds of homes and jobs were destroyed in the blaze.&#8220;Gail-force winds thrashed through the Cape blowing a wildfire along the Garden Route from Knysna to Port Alfred. In its path lives were lost homes demolished families torn apart and the natural environment destroyed &#8221; a statement issued on behalf of Gift of the Givers said on Friday.&#8220;But amid the ash and soot there was hope as South Africans extended their hearts and hands to help those in need. &#8221;Dr Imtiaz Sooliman founder of the foundation said: &#8220;People think that if you go to a disaster area you will find people who are demoralised without hope. But the strange thing is the people with the greatest hope are there.&#8221;Donations can be made at the following link: http://giftofthegivers.org/donationshttp://beautifulnews.news24.com/Beautiful-News/knysna-on-fire-a-community-rebuilds-20170622-2
