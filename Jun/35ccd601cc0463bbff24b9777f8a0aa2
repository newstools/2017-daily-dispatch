An East London man is lucky to be alive after walls of the building he was digging inside came tumbling down, burying him inside the hole he was digging. Bonginkosi Mentele, 33, was mining for bricks from the foundation of one of the building structures of the abandoned Fort Grey TB Hospital when he was almost buried alive.The hospital, situated in Santa, a neighbourhood where crime, substance abuse and unemployment is rife, has been left abandoned for over a year.The residents see the hospital as their gold mine, stripping it of whatever remains.They have been demolishing the building to sell the bricks, door frames and window frames, copper wires and water pipes.&nbsp;
