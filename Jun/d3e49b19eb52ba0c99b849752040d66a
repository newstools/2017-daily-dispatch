Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle and Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe got more than they bargained for at the launch of the Black Business Forum in East London on Thursday night, as local business people asked them tough questions on how the state went about doing its business. Among issues brought up in controversial questions put to the ANC-run government were Buffalo City Metro s failure to revive the Mdantsane pool in NU2.The pool, built in the 1960s by the then Ciskei homeland leader Lennox Sebe, was a source of pride for the youth, who used it for basic swimming training.But since the mid-80s, the structure has become dilapidated with overgrown grass and collapsed walls.The municipality once had an ambitious plan as part of the Mdantsane Urban Renewal Programme (Murp) in 2009 to renovate the pool.The Dispatch reported at the time that it would be converted into an Olympic-sized pool with a splash deck, diving pool and short-course pool but instead it has become an empty shell for many years and houses hardened criminals.Addressing hundreds of guests during the launch at the East London Independent Development Zone, one of the founders of the forum, Vukile Pokwana, said reviving such facilities in areas such as Mdantsane, Butterworth and Mthatha could have far-reaching implications now that the state has ambitions of tapping into the oceans economy.Pokwana said: We want to say as long as there is no swimming pool in Mdantsane, when the oceans economy kicks off, none of those kids will be able to work in the sea because [they] can t swim. So for as long as you continue delaying building a pool there [in townships] this oceans [economy)] will be a pipe dream.He said the BBF wanted to be central in revitalising the township economy . It is unfair that the Eastern Cape is known for having great thinkers but these ideas are being implemented in other provinces such as KZN and Gauteng, he said.He said as black business, they were inspired by Premier Masualle when he tabled his policy speech earlier in the year, committing to effecting the 30-day turnaround period for payments to state suppliers and 30% local procurement and sourcing quota for Eastern Cape companies.Pokwana said: &#8230; what we need to do as the BBF is to set up a committee to find out how far this is. We want to find out what is the [procurement] spend of this [Buffalo City] municipality that [Ncedo] Kumbaca represents here? How much of the billions of this metro go to you and me, he added.Responding to the call, both Masualle and Radebe committed to working with the forum to find lasting solutions to the challenges.Delivering his speech, Radebe said black business people should no longer be mere minority shareholders in established business. They must be producers and financiers. They must start their own businesses and they must be equipped to run them. De-racialising the economy also means leveraging the procurement spend of the state and of the private sector in a fair and transparent manner to promote black and women-owned businesses, he said. zineg@dispatch.co.za
