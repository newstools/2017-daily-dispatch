A pre-trial conference in the matter involving former Amathole district municipality (ADM) mayor Nomasikizi Konza and four others was postponed in the East London Regional Court yesterday. Konza is set to go on trial in a date yet to be decided by the court in connection with R2.5-million the municipality donated to a beauty pageant in 2015 while she was mayor.She is facing the charges alongside her political ally, Nanziwe Rulashe, who hosted the beauty pageant, Rulashe s younger sister Anita, Sigcinile Saba and Mawande Njeza. The state alleges that some of the ADM money ended up in their bank accounts.At the time of the alleged fraud, Rulashe was the ANC ward councillor in the then-Nkonkobe municipality, and former chairwoman of the municipal public accounts committee at ADM.The accused were all present in court yesterday before presiding magistrate Nomthandazo Vabaza.Court proceedings got under way with lawyers representing the accused requesting the matter be postponed to July 17 due to logistical reasons.Konza s attorney Ncumisa Nongogo told Vabaza that the defence was ready for trial but we have requested further particulars from the state and we are still waiting for them. We don t want the trial to be delayed but we want to be provided with particulars within two weeks, Nongogo said.In his response state prosecutor Diniso Ketani said he was of the opinion that he had supplied the defence with everything they needed. He promised he would go back to his file and check what information required by the defence was outstanding.Vabaza told the parties: Let us come back on the 17th of July and see how far we have gone regarding the supply of further particulars by the state. Meanwhile, Rulashe s R10000 bail money was forfeited to the state when she was arrested yesterday for failing to appear in court to face charges against her.Rulashe did not appear in court for the hearing of the case on March 28, April 24 and 25. After the fraud matter was postponed, Rulashe was referred to bail court to formally apply for another bail.Her bail application was heard by magistrate Nazeem Joemath. Rulashe was represented by advocate Mike Maseti, who told the court his client had missed the previous hearing as she could not get a flight due to the SAA strike.Joemath set Rulashe new bail at R5000. zwangam@dispatch.co.za
