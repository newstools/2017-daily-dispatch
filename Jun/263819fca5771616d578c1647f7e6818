IN HER OWN WORDS: Former Democratic Alliance leader Helen Zille issued this apology&#8230; &#8220;After a period of debate and reflection I recognise the offence caused by my tweet on 16 March 2017 with regard to the legacy of colonialism. I therefore apologise unreservedly to the South African public who were offended by this tweet and my subsequent explanation of it.In South Africa colonialism and apartheid subjugated and oppressed a majority and benefitted a minority on the basis of race. This is indeed indefensible and I do not support justify praise or promote it.I realise the wounds of history that my tweet and subsequent defence of it has opened. In particular I recognise that my actions were insensitive to South Africans who suffered under colonial oppression. For this I am genuinely sorry.During this period I have made public utterances that have had the effect of undermining the Leader of the Democratic Alliance and the project he is leading. I greatly regret this. Mmusi Maimane is the democratically elected Leader of the DA and we must all get behind his leadership.My intention now is to do everything I can to restore the public trust that has been eroded. Now more than ever we need to unite behind a shared vision of one nation with one future.&#8221;&#8211; BusinessLIVE
