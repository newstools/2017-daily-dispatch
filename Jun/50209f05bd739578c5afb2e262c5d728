Two security guards from Baziya clinic outside Mthatha have died after being exposed to carbon monoxide, one of them has been airlifted to hospital in a critical condition. Provincial spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said the guards are believed to have died from carbon monoxide poisoning.&#8220;We urge members of the public to exercise extra caution during this winter time.&#8220;Remember that it is extremely dangerous to use coal and imbawula in closed spaces or environment,&#8221; he said.Carbon monoxide is an odorless gas from coal and burning it replaces oxygen in the blood system and the brain is then robbed of oxygen. The exposed person can fall asleep, end up in a coma or dead.&#8220;That is why coal cannot be used in closed space with windows closed. We send our heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased guards and wish the hospitalised a speedy recovery,&#8221; said Kupelo.
