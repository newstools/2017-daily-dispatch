Afrikaner interest group AfriForum says it has requested police minister Fikile Mbalula to urgently intervene in a planned nationwide strike involving police emergency line workers. Hein Gonzales the organisation s community safety legal and risk advisor said they have sent a written demand to Mbalula requesting him to provide AfriForum with a proactive action plan to avoid a crisis in South Africa due to the planned strike. Considering that no less than eight farm murders were committed in the past month and the overall crime crisis that the country is facing it is extremely worrying that such a strike is being planned he said. Gonzalez said they were anxiously awaiting the minister s urgent response and stressed that AfriForum would be happy to assist and join forces with the SAPS in this matter should it be necessary.The SA Police Union (Sapu) handed over a memorandum to Mbalula s office on Tuesday demanding a salary increase for 10111 personnel as recommended by a task team set up by suspended police commissioner Riah Phiyega in 2013.According to Sapu the task team s report recommended that the salary scale at 10111 be upgraded from level five to level seven.The ministry of police has less than 14 days to respond positively or face the nationwide shutdown of the essential police emergency line.
