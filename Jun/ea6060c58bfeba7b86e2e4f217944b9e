By ZINE GEORGE and ZINGISA MVUMVUNo ANC members will be allowed to sing derogatory songs about party leaders at the policy conference which starts on Friday, party leaders announced at a press conference in Nasrec at midday today. Addressing the media, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said no one would be held to account for familiar ANC songs such &#8220;This is the Zuma we know&#8230; nguZuma lo abamaziyo abazange bambona.&#8221;He said the same goes for when the same song people name him (Mantashe).&#8220;We are not confused about the songs. We know struggle songs of the movement but we will tamper with new songs that are intended to hurt leaders of the movement,&#8221; said Mantashe.In an attempt to drive the party&#8217;s point home he made reference to a song which is famous at Cosatu meetings, saying atsamaye, leotlwile taba tse monate bare Zuma atsamaye (have you heard the good news that Zuma is going).The song was sang at Cosatu extended central committee meeting in May to welcome ANC presidential hopeful Cyril Ramaphosa. This was a few weeks after President Jacob Zuma whom Cosatu has declared that they want to resign as SA President, was booed at a May Day rally in Bloemfontein on May 1.He said such songs won&#8217;t be sung at this conference because &#8220;we want songs to unite not to hurt our leaders&#8221;.Zuma is scheduled to give his overview to guide the policy discussions at 9pm on Friday, while Mantashe will present his diagnostic report. A report on the party&#8217;s strategy and tactics would also be delivered on day one of the five-day conference, spokesman Zizi Kodwa also announced to the media.
