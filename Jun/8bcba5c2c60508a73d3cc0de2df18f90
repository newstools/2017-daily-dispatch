The six suspects who are aged between 25 and 40 will appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court soon on charges of murder kidnapping armed robbery possession of stolen goods and possession of an unlicensed firearm.Police spokesman Kay Makhubele confirmed that a man who used to work for the family was among the six arrested. They were arrested in Soweto Olifantsfontein and on the East Rand late last night and during the early hours of this morning by the provincial trio crimes unit. Makhubele said during the arrests police recovered a handgun that was allegedly used to shoot the victims. We also recovered household electrical appliances which were stolen in the robbery.
