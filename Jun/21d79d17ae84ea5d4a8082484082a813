A multimillion-rand housing project in Mdantsane has left Daluxolo residents living in fear after it was abandoned in a partially built state in 2015 and became a haven for criminals. The Buffalo City Metro (BCM) project, called the Mdantsane Cluster 2 housing project, was scheduled for completion in April 2016.Residents had blamed the defunct project for contributing to the spike in killings and rape of women. Community members told the Saturday Dispatch this week that unfinished houses are used as crime dens. Some of the houses are nearly finished but have no roof, doors or windows.Johannesburg-based Siyavuna Trading company was awarded the R163.7-million tender in 2014 for the construction of 908 houses. It was later cut to R62-million for 266 houses.The construction on eight sites, namely Sisulu, Winnie Mandela, Francis Meli, Hani Pak, Mahlangu, Gwentshe, Mathemba Vuso and Doluxolo, has come to a complete standstill.The budget cut came about as a result of BCM municipality failing to do site plans before the building began.At Daluxolo, the community of 361 residents was expecting at least 88 houses, but due to the municipality s budget cut, only 59 can be built.Ten structures reached roof level, while others stalled at their foundations and are now overgrown with grass and weeds.Daluxolo informal settlement resident Ntombiyakhe Sambana said residents had reported that rapes and other crimes were happening behind the cover of the incomplete structures at an Integrated Development Plan (IDP) meeting in April. We have written numerous letters to the municipality and had protests, hoping to get their attention, but that all fell on deaf ears. At an IDP meeting, the municipality said they would look into the issue, but nothing has been done, she said.Sambane said they wanted BCM to clear all the rubble that was left by the construction company. We have also asked BCM to appoint a new contractor, she said.At the time of going to print, BCM had not responded to questions. Despite numerous attempts, Siyavuna Trading company could not be reached for comment.
