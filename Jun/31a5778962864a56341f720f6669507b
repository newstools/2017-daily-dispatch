A video of a fight between two schoolgirls from Louis Rex Primary School, Queenstown, which is being widely circulated on Facebook and via Whatsapp, has sparked outrage from parents. Several parents contacted this week said they were sickened by the violence in the video. They questioned why the said pupils were outside the premises during school hours and why they were not under supervision.The parents asked to remain anonymous, citing fears their children would be victimised.The video shows the girls exchanging blows near a spaza shop, while pupils can be heard cheering them on.The video, which lasts for close on two minutes, was shared on Whatsapp and Facebook. It starts off with a group of girls giggling, while someone can be heard telling the girls to start fighting.The two girls appear to be reluctant at first, but then begin to exchange blows in the video, where foul language is also used.The video eventually stops with one of the bystanders heard saying, Here comes the auntie .When the Dispatch sister newspaper The Rep visited the school on Wednesday, principal Bevan Christoffels was in a meeting with the parents of the girls involved. We called in the parents to discuss this matter and we will talk to members of our SGB about this. We cannot disclose much at the moment on why they were fighting, he said.He said the incident happened during break time and that the pupils had left the school premises without permission. They are not allowed to leave the schoolyard during school time, but these girls left without anyone knowing about it. I am disappointed because this damages the image of our school. It is a difficult time, because we are starting with exams on Monday. The video can be seen on www.dispatch.co.za. The children s faces have been obscured to protect their identities.
