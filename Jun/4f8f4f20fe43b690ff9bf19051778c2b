Builder Mandla Dlokwana celebrated his 50th birthday with 50 cakes for the less fortunate yesterday. He also threw in a few buckets of fried chicken, soft drinks and chips.Dlokwana owns Mandla Constructions and a petrol station in Mdantsane.He began the day by donating 25 cakes to Vukuhambe School for 152 pupils with special needs from Grade R to Grade 12.Dlokwana says he was raised in a household where giving back and helping others was part of life. It makes me feel good to do something for someone else on this day instead of celebrating with a party with friends. He also donated cakes to NGOs in Duncan Village, Ducets, Gonubie and Beacon Bay, as well as the Good Samaritan Child and Youth Centre.He chose organisations that care for children suffering from long-term illnesses and disabilities.Deputy principal Nomthandazo Luphuwana said the pupils welcomed people who showed kindness to them. She said it was a difficult and emotional time for pupils when they discovered they were different.Under a bright winter s sun, the children and Dlokwana sang Happy Birthday to Dlokwana three times.Grade 4 students Wam and Ludwe, both aged 11, when asked for their comment, shouted Yay! at the top of their lungs.Luphuswana said the gesture for the youth came at an appropriate time, only days from June 16.She thanked Dlokwana for his kindness, saying some of the pupils came from tough backgrounds and appreciated the gesture. They do not have parents. Some are ill and have nobody to care for them and some are not financially able to be taken care of in regard to their complex challenges. Principal Wesley Thole said: It was a good event, fantastic.
